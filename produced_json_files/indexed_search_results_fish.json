        "content": "I hadn\u2019t seen the land of smiles for 10 years.Thailand saw me becoming a certified diverand adivemaster, so the Southeast Asian country will always have a special place in my heart. This is where my life took a different turn. I was excited and anxious at the same time. Would I still love it? One sure thing, I had to do things differently this time. The three first times, I got stuck on Koh Tao, as I fell in love with the vibe of this tiny island in the Gulf of Thailand. But with so many exciting places to visit and reefs to scuba dive,how to decide on a new itinerary?\nDid you know the land of smiles was also theland of national parks? 156, to be exact! Thailand is thesecond country in the world for its number of national parks, behind Australia. While many are in mountainous areas, 14 include coastal areas, mangroves and coral reefs, and you can go scuba diving in 9 of them. So,that\u2019s how I set sail for the Andaman coast, home to most of these protected marine areas. I flew from Bali to Bangkok in early January and then used a mix of buses and boats to reach the Similan, Surin, Phi Phi and Lanta marine national parks.\nThe story ofthis one-month voyage in the south of Thailand can be used as a 2-week itineraryif you land at Phuket or Krabi Airport, and stay between Khao Lak and Koh Lanta. In my case, the only direct flights from Bali are to Bangkok. Anyway, I really fancied spending time in the bustling Thai capital again. As I try not to take domestic flights whenever there are reasonably good land or sea alternatives, I took a night bus from Bangkok to Khao Lak via Surat Thani for a total journey of 16 hours, a speedboat between Phuket and Koh Lanta in only 2 hours, then a bus and a ferry from Koh Lanta to Koh Tao for a total trip of 10 hours. In the end, I returned to Bangkok via Chumphon after taking the ferry (1h30) and a bus (8 hours). Here is how it went\u2026\nPlan your underwater adventures in Thailand with the interactive map below. It showcases the best dive sites, themost beautiful beaches and the\u00a0ferry terminalsbesides the different available airports\u00a0to organise your trip. I did most of this itinerary by\u00a0booking buses and boats. The only exception was my night taxi between Khao Lak and Phuket Old Town.\nIt was the number one objective of this trip and the reason why I decided to travel to Thailand in January. The Similan Islands are the spot I heard over and over again, every time I went diving in Thailand.It was time to see if it deserved to be named Thailand\u2019s best dive spot. There are two ways to explore the Similan Islands: with a liveaboard cruise from 3 to 7 days with up to 4 dives a day or with a speedboat for a day trip with a 90-minute bumpy ride each way, leaving time only for 2 dives. In any case, the gateway to the Similan Islands is Khao Lak.\nI chose the liveaboard option because there are many dive spots within the Similan archipelago: 9 islands (named Similan no.1, Similan no.2, etc.) plus Koh Bon and Koh Tachai. I wanted to see a little of everything, sothe liveaboard was the most economical option. As someone who did her first liveaboard in the Galapagos, the price difference was quite a shock:Thailand is one of the most affordable places in the world to experience a scuba diving liveaboard. It is especially true since you don\u2019t have to go for an entire week. I chose a 4-day/4-night cruise with a total of 15 dives for less than 700\u20ac, which obviously included accommodation but also 5 meals a day and unlimited soft drinks and snacks.\nI took the time the days before the liveaboard departure toexplore Khao Lak, famous for its long sandy beaches. But it is such a vast area that it took me some digging and being back driving a scooter 10 years after I learnt during my divemaster in Koh Tao. The advantage of the size of Khao Lak is that people are spread out along its 40 km main road, so you never feel overwhelmed. But while this 3-lane road left me a bit puzzled at first, from the moment I took the side roads through coconut groves, Khao Lak beaches didn\u2019t disappoint.\nNot only areKhuk Khak Beach, Coconut Beach, and Nang Thong Beachsome of the most stunning I have seen worldwide, but each has a different topography and vibe. I loved how wide and wild Khuk Khak was. Coconut Beach was a pretty sheltered bay, looking like a lagoon. Nang Thong Beach was the most scenic at sunset, with its lighthouse, surfers and collared kingfishers flying around.\nI boarded myscuba diving boatatTap Lamu Harbourthe night before we started diving. I smiled when I saw a name written in Thai beside mine on my cabin door. It wasn\u2019t long before Wan, a Thai diver from Bangkok, and I became friends. The time to prepare my scuba diving gear and my underwater camera, I fell asleep rocked by the waves as we set sails for the Similan Islands.\nWaking up atsunrise in the Similan Islandswith a cup of real coffee before the bell rang was the best possible start. The next three days followed the same organisation: breakfast at 7.00 am, 1st dive at 8.00 am, breakfast/lunch at 9.30 am, 2nd dive at 11.00 am, lunch at 12.30 pm, 3rd dive at 3.00 pm, snack at 4.30 pm, night dive at 6.00 pm and dinner at 7.30 pm. We were 22 divers on board, so we got organised into 4 groups, taking turns each day on who was going first.\nThe dives on the first two days were in the Similan Islands per se, including a sunset stop at the Sailrock viewpoint to take a few pictures. The dive sites were a mix of shallow gardens with animpressive diversity of healthy hard coralsand many large sea anemones with clownfish, steep walls with scattered yellow gorgonians which feather stars seemed to love, and giant pyramid-looking smooth rocks. We enjoyed hour-long relaxing dives as the dive sites were sheltered from the currents initially, but once we reached Similan Island no.9, the currents started to peak.\nDuring the day, thanks to the excellent visibility, I focused on wide-angle pictures to capture theunderwater landscapes teaming with schools of glassfish(note their real name is pygmy sweeper), Randal\u2019s fusiliers and blue-stripped snappers. No shark in sight, but we got the visit of a sizable green turtle on one of our safety stops. It stayed around us for a few minutes and came right to my camera as if asking me to take its picture.\nNight divinggave us the opportunity to search for nudibranchs and other macro critters, such as ornate ghost pipefish. Still no shark in sight, but we spotted a couple of giant cuttlefish mating while joining their tentacles. It was more than enough to make our day!\nOn the third day, things got exciting when we reached Koh Bon and Koh Tachai.The currents were stronger but nothing too crazy. It is always the underlying price of meeting bigger fish. Enormous schools of trevally and emperor fish welcomed us, swirling all around. Closer to the surface, the batfish were both timid and curious but didn\u2019t mind me taking a few pictures. The size of the gorgonians was easily double compared to our first dives, forming elegant bouquets of different colours, punctuated with the red whip coral and pink soft corals.\nThe highlight was, without a doubt, ourencounter with a manta ray in Koh Bon, but my favourite dives remained Koh Tachai. I loved its dense gorgonian gardens, the giant barracudas swirling around me, and the \u201clobster condos\u201d below its shallow reefs while having fun managing the currents with my best fin kicks.\nFrom Similan Island #4 to Koh Tachai, the Similan Marine National Park deliveredepic dives in a pristine environmentwith great visibility and reasonable currents. I found the dives manageable and even maybe a great opportunity for beginner divers to gain confidence in drift diving. Koh Tachai was my favourite, while the Similan no.4/7/8/9 were nice dives without being incredible. I understand better now why someliveaboards in Thailandfocus on the northern part of the Similan Marine National Park.\nOurliveaboardkept heading north until we reached another marine national park for our final diving day: the Surin Islands. Right below Myanmar (Burma), the Surin Marine National Park is home to one of Thailand\u2019s most famous dive sites:Richelieu Rock. As the dive guide announced at the dive briefing, you can find 80% of the Indian Ocean Fish ID book at Richelieu Rock. That sounded quite promising, so I prayed for whale sharks.\nOn the last day of our liveaboard, we had the time for 3 dives at Richelieu Rock before heading back to Tap Lamu in 8 hours. While no whale shark came to say hi, everything I saw during those 3 dives clearly put Richelieu Rockon the list of the best dive sites worldwide. The small rock you see at the surface is actually a giant underwater pinnacle. Each dive was quite similar in that we went around it from the deepest to the shallows, making u-turns halfway, depending on the currents. However, on each dive, I saw something new.\nThe amount ofgiant trevally, blue trevally and emperor fish forming giant and powerful waves was staggering. There were so many of them that I almost stopped paying attention after the first dive, as they were everywhere. Batfish were there, still curious, and giant cuttlefish, too, still busy mating.\nI was so surprised to see there were also many macro critters to look for: There were two harlequin shrimps busy eating a starfish tentacle and many more nudibranchs I had never seen before. I loved the bright orangetomato anemone fishin their green sea anemone, as they are not as common as other anemone fish.\nAmong the divers diving regularly in the Similan Islands and Surin Islands, there are#TeamKohTachaiand#TeamRichelieuRock. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t choose, I loved both, and I recommend having them both on the itinerary of yourSimilan diving liveaboard.\nTo get from Khao Lak to Koh Lanta right after my diving liveaboard, the best solution was anovernight stay in Phuketand take the boat to Koh Lanta via Koh Phi Phi. Despite my initial doubts, I discoveredthere is more to Phuket than Patong Beach. It is actually a big island with many different sides. This is especially true in Phuket Old Town\u2019s colourful old Chinese shophouses and multitude of adorable caf\u00e9s.\nThe added benefit was being only 20 minutes away from Rassada Pier, where you can board for Koh Phi Phi and Koh Lanta. After a morning of photographing the colourful heritage architecture and drinking the best coffee of my trip,I boarded at 12.30 pm the last direct speedboatfor Koh Lanta.\nThe boat was packed. However, I quickly realised that of the many people on board,I was the only one with the pink Koh Lanta sticker. It was a first hint. I consciously skipped Koh Phi Phi when making my itinerary due to the overtourism it suffers from (especiallyMaya Bay). Only 3 couples joined me on board in Koh Phi Phi, so we all had plenty of space to enjoy the last 30 minutes of the boat ride.\nI was glad to have2 nights in a stylish resort to restfrom the past week before getting underwater again. I couldn\u2019t choose a better place than theAvani+ Koh Lanta. Only a short ride from Saladan Pier, its rooms and private villas are distributed on two hills with a private beach on each side among lush nature. And the cherry on top is meeting itsresident family of thornbills! Luckily, the pool of my villa was right in front of their nest, so I had many opportunities to watch them quietly.\nWhereas it was about thehealthy breakfast as a picnic on the beach, floating in my private pool while snacking on local sweets, the hour-long essential oil massage at the spa, or tasting the best Thai cuisine in a vegetarian version, everything was on point to recharge my batteries.\nOn my third day, asOK Club Divingpicked me up at 7.15 am at the hotel, I discovered we were heading back to Koh Phi Phi! I understood then that the bay formed by Phuket, Krabi and Koh Lanta is a fabulous underwater playground for scuba divers, and the Phi Phi islands being in the middle, you can access it from any point. The archipelago includes Koh Phi Phi Don (the main island with the hotels), Koh Phi Phi Lee (where Maya Bay is) andKoh Bida Nai & Koh Biba Nok. The two last ones, the southernmost tip of the Phi Phi Islands, are the scuba divers\u2019 paradise of theMu Ko Phi Phi National Park.\nWhen we arrived, I quickly recognised the high karst limestone islands that made Koh Phi Phi internationally famous. They are likerocky towers floating above the sea. Koh Bida Nai and Koh Bida Nok are no exception. So it\u2019s by the impressive cliffs of Koh Bida Nai that one giant stride later, I was back underwater.\nThe cliff continues underwater, reaching a reasonable depth of 21 m. The amount of fish was incredibly dense. Massive schools of yellow snappers were swirling around us, sometimes completely engulfing us. While I already had a taste ofcolder thermoclines pushed by currentsin the Surin Islands, this is where I felt the biggest temperature difference, with a minimum temperature of 25\u00b0C at 20 m. I actually enjoyed the 3\u00b0C difference with the surface, as I often felt too warm with my 3/4mm full wetsuit. But the thermocline is also murkier, meaning it is full of nutrients. While it lowers the visibility and the brightness level sometimes, there is no doubt it makes the fish thrive here.\nI spent most of the dive photographing in wide-angle thegiant orange gorgonians punctuated by elegant red harp coralwhile the yellow snappers put on a show in the background. But towards the end of the dive, Sebastien, my dive guide, showed me to have a closer look at the wall. We found whip coral goby, coral banded shrimp and a desirable flabellina (Flabellina Exoptata), which remains one of my favourite nudibranchs with its deep pink colour with a touch of yellow on the tips of itscerata.\nAfter an hour of surface interval, we headed to the neighbouring island of Koh Bida Nok for a much shallower dive in its lagoon. Seconds after deflating my BCD, I was welcomed by a dense, shiny school of diamond fish. After passing a few half-closed purple sea anemones where pink anemone fish played peekaboo, we arrived at a5 m deep natural rocky pool. My attention was immediately drawn to a squad of bigfin reef squid. Right below the surface, their translucent body reflected the sun in shimmery colours. And while trying to get a closer shot of the squids, I heard a loud \u201cHumph!\u201d next to me\u2026 black tip sharks!\nA whole shiver ofyoung black-tip sharks! As chasing is never the way to get a good shot, I tried to analyse their swimming pattern and position myself strategically, but no, they always turned before being at the proper distance to my camera. A least I finally saw sharks in Thailand!\nWhen I thought I already had a good day, we continued along a shallow wall (maximum depth 16 m) and found only meters from each other, hiding in a cavity, ayellow tigertail seahorseand an ornate ghost pipefish! The seahorse got me the most excited as they tend to be extremely camera shy, and finally, I got my best shot of a yellow seahorse. Imagine how thrilled I was after such a day.\nI might have found the most underrated scuba diving spot in Thailand. Like most divers, I mostly heard about the Similan Islands and Richelieu Rock over and over again. Never, ever did the name ofKoh Haareach my ears or my laptop screen before. I had the opportunity to scuba dive there 2 days in a row, just to be sure I had found my favourite dive spot in Thailand!\nKoh Haa is a group of 5 islands, as its name states in Thai. It belongs to theMu Ko Lanta National Park, together with the south of Lanta Yai Island. Almost all scuba diving boats in Koh Lanta leave from the harbour of Saladan, north of Koh Lanta Yai.\nI could try the two options to get to Koh Haa withOK Club Diving. You can go by either a regular boat (a former fishing boat) or a speedboat. The first one is slower as it takes 2 hours to reach Koh Haa and the same time to return.It only takes 40 minutes with the speedboat, so not only do you sleep more in the morning, but you can also be first on the dive site. There is a price difference (300 BHT/ 8\u20ac), but both have advantages. It depends on whether you prefer having time to nap with plenty of space onboard or are eager to explore the island in the afternoon after diving.\nAmong the 5 islands of Koh Haa, 3 are extraordinary dive sites :\nThe reason I loved diving in Koh Haa so much is due to its tremendous diversity. Shallow, deep, walls, coral gardens, caverns, swim-through, you name it! On both days, we started by \u201cCorner Lagoon\u201d in Koh Haa #3 aswe went to the deepest point (26 m) to hopefully see some bull or leopard sharks. Unfortunately, no sight of a shark fin on both dives but a peacock mantis shrimp crossing the sandy bottom over to the nearest den. You know the story with nature\u2026\nWhile keeping an eye on the blue, I admired thesoft coral reefs coming in all shades of red, purple, pink, yellow, orange, and enveloped in a mesmerising layer of pygmy sweepers. This is also where I found some extraordinary nudibranchs like the mosaic halgerda (HalgerdaIndotessella) and the twin chromodoris (Goniobranchius Geminus) that I mistakenly took for the Kuniei type from New Caledonia \u2013 the only difference, a white line!\nThe 5th island is rightfully nicknamed \u201cCathedral\u201d. Itstwo interconnected underwater caverns, 10 to 15 m high, reminded me of Malta last year, except this time, the water was 27\u00b0C, and the cave entrance was covered in corals. As often, when making a U-turn at the cavern\u2019s end, the view of its glowing blue entrance is an enchantment. Next to the exit, I met the resident giant grouper of the islet. This 2 m long baby kept its distance but showed friendly and curious behaviour. Approaching gently, step by step, it let me take a few close-up shots I was delighted with.\nIsland No. 1 was indeed my #1 dive site. Nicknamed \u201cChimney\u201d due to itsnarrow tunnel, one part being vertical, through the coral reef, where you must display your best buoyancy control and move forward with gentle frog kicks. Many more swim-throughs, arches and canyons were decorated with colourful bouquets of soft corals. We also passed clownfish playing hide and seek, schooling trevally and emperor fish, and a turtle came to say hi before our final safety stop.\nIt\u2019s important to note that there are, a bit further, two other islands belonging to the Lanta Marine National Park,Hin Daeng and Hin Muang. Some say it\u2019s even better than Richelieu Rock, with high chances of seeing whale sharks and manta rays in March-April. Unfortunately, an intense jellyfish bloom put off most operators from going at the time of my visit due to divers coming back stung even in full wetsuits. I\u2019ll have to come back!\nBefore leaving Koh Lanta, I took the time toexplore its inland side on a scooter road trip(my longest ever, about 65 km, yay!). I absolutely loved driving on the quiet roads of Koh Lanta, lined up with colourful hibiscus, while monkeys jumped above our heads between palm trees and electric poles.\nThere are beaches all along Lanta Yai western shore, but the most stunning are located in the south, especially the part that belongs to the Lanta National Park (200 BHT entrance). My favourites?Relax Bay, Kantian Bay and Laemtanod Beachin the national park. The latter was by far the most scenic with its lighthouse (make sure to climb up the nature trail after the lotus pond for a breathtaking view from above).\nWandering around the streets ofOld Lanta Townon the East Coast was then the perfect combination with the lush nature of the national park: the old wooden houses, the red Chinese lanterns swinging with the wind, the view from the piers above the water, and\u2026 the food!\nOld Lanta Town is where I had themost delicious Thai food in my entire trip. I had lunch at the Shine Talay restaurant, which offers fresh seafood and even seagrapes, the seaweed calledumibudoin Japanese, which I used to love in Okinawa. I ordered a spicy seagrape salad and apad see ew, my favourite stir-fried fresh wide rice noodles. It was so tasty that I wasn\u2019t surprised when I heard the restaurant was a favourite among local families who would come together once a month for a treat.\nWhile January is a great month to dive in the Andaman Coast, it\u2019s not the case on the other side, in the Gulf of Thailand. But I couldn\u2019t resist going to Koh Tao after 10 years without visiting Thailand. I had to see how it had turned.Koh Tao being halfway to Bangkok from Koh Lanta was the perfect excuse. Would it have changed too much?\nSo that\u2019s how I embarked on a 10-hour trip doing bus-ferry-bus-ferry. A breathtaking sunset welcomed me when I arrived at Mae Haad, Koh Tao\u2019s main harbour.My fear of finding it too changed immediately vanished. Of course, the island is more built up than before, but I saw more changes between 2009 and 2013, than between 2014 and now. This is especially true in the case of Chalok Ban Kao, the beach in the south of the island which remains my absolute favourite spot to stay.\nI was pleasantly surprised with an improved road network allowing me toexplore secluded beaches and viewpoints on a scooter. On top of this, while my favourite local food institutions were still there (Tukta,Dee Dee), there were new cute caf\u00e9s (Kopee,High the Moon, andCulture Coffee) and many international food options (Personally, I stick to Asian cuisine \u2013 Chinese withGemini Dumplings, Japanese/Korean withAsia Moods).\nDiving-wise, I knew what I was into with low visibility in January. I was surprised that the prices have remained affordable in Koh Tao, with fun dives still starting at 800 BHT (about 21\u20ac). Going diving still consists of transferring from the beach in a small boat to a big former fishing boat with plenty of space and a compressor on board. Dive sites are 15 to 45 minutes away. This is why dive centres can offer up to 5 dives a day (night dive included).Koh Tao is diving made easy. I now realise how much I was spoiled to start my diving career there and how hassle-free it is. Small but not too small, Koh Tao has it all, besides a close-knit diving community and the opportunity to make new friends every day just as passionate about the ocean.\nAfter 22 dives in the Andaman Coast, there is no denying that Koh Tao cannot compare with the beauty of dive sites like Koh Tachai, Richelieu Rock or Koh Haa. But on the other hand, the price tag is not the same. Despite the challenging visibility in January (we are talking about 10-15 m), I could see thatChumpon Pinnacle still deserves to be my favourite Koh Tao dive site: hundreds of sea anemones covering the rocks, giant barrel sponges, massive schools of barracudas and yellow snappers, and always the shy but curious giant groupers. An excellent surprise came as I rediscovered Green Rock with exciting swim-throughs and many nudibranchs to look for. Kudos toFrench Kiss Diversinstructors and divemasters for showing me nudibranchs I had never seen before in Koh Tao!\nThis trip was everything I could hope for and more. Besides Koh Tao,I have a new favourite place in Thailand, Koh Lanta. Next time, I want to return in March, explore new areas such as Krabi and Koh Lipe, and hopefully see leopard and whale sharks. The options as a scuba diver in Thailand are almost endless.  Now that I am not far away, I won\u2019t have to wait 10 more years!\nHere are a few extrauseful tips to go diving in Southern Thailandand make the most of your trip. Let\u2019s look at the diving seasons, the marine park fees you need to budget, and the coolest dive centres and hotels to book.\nThis is key information: in Thailand, the rainy season isn\u2019t all over the country at the same time.There are two rainy seasons. While the part of Thailand from Chiang Mai to Phuket via Bangkok (Northern, Central and Andaman Coast) has its rainy season from May to October, the Gulf of Thailand (Koh Samui and Koh Tao) has its rainy season from October to January. So, if you do the math, the best season to do a scuba diving tour of Thailand on both the West and East coasts is from February to April.\nRegarding the best diving conditions,water is at its clearest in the Andaman coast from January to April and Koh Tao from March to June. If you consider that the peak season to see whale sharks is February-March, especially in Koh Tao, where there have been more sightings in recent years, that leaves us witha sweet spot in March. However, you can dive all year long in Thailand by choosing the area wisely. Regarding water temperatures, you can always expect warm waters, usually between 26 and 30\u00b0C. I recommend a 3mm full wetsuit (the full wetsuit being in case you run into a jellyfish bloom).\nIn any case, because of the conditions at sea,the Similan and the Surin Marine National Parks are closed from the 16thof May to the 14thof October every year, and so are the dive sites of the Lanta Marine National Park from the 1stof July to the 30thof August. These annual closures allow the ecosystems to recover from the tourism pressure at a time when it\u2019s not ideal to visit anyway. Well done, Thailand!\nThefees only apply to the marine national parksof the Andaman Coast. Koh Tao is not a national park; there is no additional fee when diving there. Make sure you have some spare cash when diving in the Similan Islands, Koh Phi Phi or Koh Lanta.\nHere are the different fees to add on top of the price of your dives:\nRegarding theSimilan Islands, the liveaboard was much cheaper when I compared the cost of staying in Khao Lak and a diving day trip. Besides, this is the best solution to enjoy a bit of everything when you have never dived in the Similan Islands before. On top of 4 dives a day (instead of 2 for the day trip) and all the delicious Thai food we were fed on board (including Mukata Thai barbecue dinner), I calculated each dive to be around 25\u20ac. It is just unbeatable.\nThere are quite a few scuba diving liveaboard touring the Similan Islands, but they are not at sea all the time and the cruise duration varies. Checkliveaboard.comto find what suits your dates and budget. Most boats look similar, and it\u2019s hard to be disappointed with the food in Thailand. In any case, I loved feeling like I was camping at sea and meeting the Thai diving community.\nInKoh Lanta, I cannot recommend enoughOK Club Diving. Not only is it an excellent training centre for all levels up to tech diving, but the knowledge of Andr\u00e9 and Sebastien of the dive sites blew my mind. They showed me marine species that would delight any underwater photographer. At the time of my visit, their speedboat was still in maintenance, so we joined other dive centres\u2019 boats. I cannot wait to return to dive from their beautiful boat (I had a sneak peek at the dockyard). Last but not least, as the diving season in the Phi Phi and Lanta marine national parks is limited, they offer cave diving for tech divers in the rainy season.\nInKoh Tao, I remained loyal to the dive centre that saw me becoming a Divemaster,French Kiss Divers. In 10 years since my last visit, they have now moved to Mae Haad, the main harbour of Koh Tao, in a beachfront facility including a chilled caf\u00e9, the \u201cO\u2019rendez-vous\u201d, offering plenty of juices, smoothies and light food options for relaxing with your dive buddies. If you are an experienced diver, you\u2019ll prefer diving in the morning: the dive sites are usually deeper and more interesting (especially Chumpon Pinnacle). If you\u2019re looking for a cheerful vibe with the bonus of croissants at the surface interval, look no further.\nHere is the list of 6 hotels I used throughout my trip in the south of Thailand:",

        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/diving-cozumel/",
        "content": "While Cozumel Island is usually listed as one of thebest diving in the Caribbean, we missed our mutual introduction 12 years ago. Here is a story about giving second chances to places that didn\u2019t succeed in giving us a good first impression. During my first trip to Mexico, while staying in Playa del Carmen, I took a day trip by ferry twice. Seeing my first ever hammerhead shark wasn\u2019t enough to make me forget a touristy side that didn\u2019t appeal to me back then.\nAs I returned to Playa del Carmen for a one-month stay, I decided to go for a long weekend in Cozumel and sleep on the island, which I didn\u2019t do the first time. Things can quickly change, andmy impressions were reversed in the end. While it used to be easy to find an authentic Mexican vibe in Playa del Carmen, it has become a giant open-air mall by day and nightclub by night (and don\u2019t get me started on the state of the beach). I loved my short stay in Cozumel so much that it almost made me regret booking a month in Playa del Carmen.\nHere are thereasons that made me fall for diving in Cozumeldespite visiting the island with an early hurricane approaching. Let me share all the facts that surprised me the most. It seems all I had to do was stay a little longer!\nDiving in Cozumelat a glance\n\nWhile living in Playa del Carmen for a month, I had already to postpone once my long weekend in Cozumel due to anearly start of the hurricane season. Anyway, it was all sunny and warm when I finally made it to the Mexican Caribbean Island at the end of May. So much I made the mistake of leaving all my warm clothes and rain jacket behind at the flat. I didn\u2019t realise another storm was coming.\nContrary to the first dates initially planned, the harbour remained open, and I could go scuba diving for 2 days as planned. On my last day, my snorkelling tour to El Cielo was cancelled, but it allowed me to explore more of the island.\nBack to diving, I could not believe the underwater conditions remained so bright and colourful. Usually, rain means reduced visibility due to the particles carried away. It seems in Cozumel, the only reason for lower visibility is finding yourself behind a carefree diver with its fins.Cozumel white sand is extremely thinand tends to react like silt if moved.\nFrom the moment I put my head below the surface,it was like someone had switched on the light. All my underwater pictures were taken during these two stormy days as proof of what I say. My estimation of the visibility in Cozumel? 30 m on a bad day and 40 m on a sunny day, maybe!\nIf you have more than 20 logged dives and want to step up your scuba diving skills,learning to manage currents underwateris an excellent way to do so. Unfortunately, in the case of currents, dive spots are usually an all-or-nothing thing (for instance, the Galapagos Islands are the last place you want to learn drift diving).\nDrift diving along Cozumel\u2019s reefs made the island famous among divers. Now I have experienced it at different seasons and with a different experience level, I can confirm this is the right level of currents you want to learn. There isno better place to appreciate drift diving as a beginner(reminder: drift diving consists of a descent at one spot and an ascent at another down the current).\nIn Cozumel, you\u2019ll definitely feel the current. Still, you\u2019ll have enough time to experiment with your buoyancy,adjust your position to slow down(perpendicularly to the current) or shelter behind a rock to see a cool marine critter.\nMost divers love the Caribbean because it\u2019s nice, warm and pretty. But I rarely hear people talking about exciting underwater encounters (except those who persist in participating in shark feed dives). It might be because I learnt how to look at reefs with a more careful eye, but I think Cozumel has something more than the other islands of the Caribbean, especially when we talk about marine species.\nFirst and foremost, let me introduce you to the scuba diving mascot of Cozumel: thesplendid toadfish\u2013Sanopus Splendidus. This adorable colourful fish comes with blue zebra strips and yellow fins. It has a wide head with a large mouth but a long body, almost like an eel.\nThe splendid toadfish isendemic to the island of Cozumelso finding one is at the top of most divers\u2019 list. Don\u2019t hesitate to tell your dive guide you hope to see one; they usually know their favourite hideout. Remember to be gentle when approaching as they tend to be extremely shy.\nAmong the other noticeable species, they are more than a few sharks (pelagic fish love currents).Bull sharksare common in the winter, but on my first trip to Cozumel in November, I saw this very firsthammerhead shark! While this is rare, thenurse sharkI saw in May is more common.\nSeeing a nurse shark doing something else than sleeping isn\u2019t common. It was actively hunting! It stayed around us doing its business for a solid 10 minutes. I also saw an enormousloggerhead turtleduring the same dive (Punta Dalila). I think this is the first time I got a picture of one.\nSome of the most common fish species of the Caribbean are the angelfish: queen angelfish, grey angelfish, and French angelfish are found from Florida to Panama. However, there was again a little guy I had never spotted before: therock beauty angelfish. It\u2019s small, so you have to look for it carefully, but its black and yellow pattern makes it highly recognisable.\nHere is a short list of the other marine species you are likely to see diving in Cozumel and featured in my underwater pictures:\nI wish more diving areas in the world would do this. While an entire closing season can be frustrating, Cozumel got the brilliant idea tolet a group of dive sites in peace for 2 monthson a rotating schedule. The program led by the authorities of theCozumel Reefs National Park(Parque Nacional Arrecifes de Cozumel) and CONANP (National Commission of Protected Areas \u2013Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de \u00c1reas Naturales Protegidas) started in 2020. The returning species proved it was working in only 2 years.\nHere is the current timetable for the dive sites closure in Cozumel:\nFor the latest information, have a look at theCozumel Reefs National Park Facebook page.\nYes, you read correctly. As you may already know,sunscreen chemicals are toxic to coral reefs. No more \u201cwhat type of sunscreen?\u201d or \u201cwhat about nano-particles?\u201d discussions in Cozumel. All types of sunscreens are prohibited. People in Cozumel say, \u201cwear UV-protected clothing!\u201d.\nThe program led byHealthy Mayan Reefincludes educational posters all around the island. For instance, you can\u2019t miss the giant poster at the exit of the ferry terminal. They give clear instructions on how to protect the pristine reefs of Cozumel in 3 main points:\nThis is a bold position after a timid tentative from some countries or islands to forbid only toxic sunscreens.\nLet\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room. I\u2019m talking about the cruise ships that boosted Cozumel tourism in the last 20 years. In case you weren\u2019t aware, these ships pollute enormously and threaten the reefs (for this reason,local activists are fighting against the construction of a new pier). I was reluctant at first to return to Cozumel because of that. However, I discovered a surprising fact by giving Cozumel another chance and staying overnight.\nTourists from the cruise ships stay on the island for over half a day.At 4 pm, all ships are already gone. It leaves the island peaceful, with the right level of the hustle and bustle in the streets of San Miguel, the island\u2019s main town.\nBasically, in the mornings, I was underwater, and by the time I had taken my shower and rinsed my scuba gear, the island was quiet again. So, in a way, it protects the island of the swallows from mass tourism by containing it (Cozumel comes from the Mayan wordCozamilwhich means swallow).\nAfter 12 years, the prices at the restaurants in Playa del Carmen sky-rocketed to American/European levels, and it was more complicated to find a local restaurant at regular prices. I used to walk to the 10thavenue; it was only on the 30thavenue this time to find a little gem (only to learn that it closed a few months later).\nAgainst all odds, this is on Cozumel Island that I had the most delicious meals without spending a fortune. Here we go for the foodie spots I found in the streets of the centre of San Miguel de Cozumel:\nI also loved my sunset cocktails on the rooftop terrace of the Cozumel Museum, theNovena Ola, and my ice cream fix at theFlamingoon the main square (Parque Benito Suarez).\nNot only the diving in Cozumel offers some of the best in the Caribbean, but if you\u2019re a nature lover, you can extend your experience by going to the island\u2019s southern tip. The nature reserve, appropriately calledPunta Sur\u2013 South Point, is the perfect excuse torent a caror a scooter todrive around the island(HTL rentals offer scooters from 20$ a day and cars from 45$ a day).\nThe entrance to thePunta Sur nature reserveis 14$ per adult. Take the time first to climb the stairs of the Celarain lighthouse. You get abreathtaking view of the ocean and the laguna separated by a thin strip of land. The trail starting behind the lighthouse offers additional opportunities to spot wildlife like birds, iguanas and tortoises, but this is at the viewpoint over the laguna that you can get a shot at meeting Cozumel\u2019s sea crocodiles.\nI thought it wouldn\u2019t be that easy to see them. Wrong! One enormous individual was quietly waiting below the deck of the viewpoint. It was slightly rainy that day, so maybe there were fewer visitors. It could explain why this crocodile stuck with us for a long time.\nNever say never. I\u2019m not a huge fan of any themed park around the local culture as it often tends to accommodate the preconception and stereotypes people have about a place. I had this unpleasant experience in the past, but Cozumel again proved me wrong.\nIn the heart of the island, the small cultural parkPueblo del Mais\u2013 Village of the corn \u2013\u00a0 is the perfect example of how things can be handled better. The attraction is managed bylocals from Cozumel who are deeply involved in preserving and sharing their Mayan cultural heritage(they organise local festivals and perform at other events all over Yucatan).\nI loved to be more than a passive visitor, only taking pictures since most of the park consists of interactive workshops where you\u2019ll get to practice different aspects of what used to be daily life in a Mayan village. A large part of them is about food, so I couldn\u2019t be happier in my case sinceI love learning recipes everywhere I travel. We madetamalesfrom scratch (steamed corn dough in a leaf) and chocolate after toasting the cocoa bean (were you aware chocolate was first created in Mexico?)\nTours are in English or Spanish. The entrance is 20$ for adults.\nIs it even possible to be a travel blogger these days without mentioning the street art scene of any given place? When I discovered the numerousocean-inspired muralsin Cozumel, I must admit it was impossible to resist talking about them.\nThese murals form part of theSea Walls projectaround the world. It\u2019s a project tobring awareness about the different threats the ocean is facing through art. Cozumel is the second location in the world with 53 of these sea walls.\nMy favourite? The mural called \u201cPerdida de coral es perdida de cultura\u201d (Lost coral is lost culture).\nWith theferries going back and forth between Cozumel and Playa del Carmen, it\u2019s easy to venture on the continent for a day trip, even if you decide to stay in Cozumel. WithWinjet ferries, it only takes 40 minutes to cross the channel between Cozumel Island and the Yucatan Peninsula. There are 7 ferry crossings on each way every day from 8 am to 9 pm. A return ticket is 25$ per adult.\nThe cenotes of Yucatan are an absolute wonder and a unique magical diving experience in the entire world. You shouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to godiving in the cenotes, even if you spend only a week on Cozumel Island. The best and closest cenotes to visit would bePonderosa and Tajma Hawhich are only a 30-minute drive away from Playa del Carmen.\nI summed up below everything you need to know to prepare for your trip to go diving in Cozumel: best season, water temperatures, best dives, best dive centre and the best places to stay.\nIt\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s always warm in the Caribbean. Unfortunately, there is one thing you need to take into account: thehurricane season. It\u2019s from June to November and especially from July to October. Note it doesn\u2019t guarantee anything since last May, we got an early start of the season in Yucatan, including a harbour closure in Cozumel. This is also the season with fewer people and lower accommodation prices.\nOne thing to point out, though, is that while thesargasso season(seaweed) in Yucatan is from May to October, Cozumel is nearly unaffected. Meanwhile, in Playa del Carmen, they have to organise truck turns to clear up the beaches every morning to give some access to the visitors.\nRegarding the water temperature, the \u201ccoldest\u201d is at 26\u00b0C from December to February, then27-28\u00b0Cfrom March to May, and up to 30\u00b0C from June to November. Cozumel has no thermoclines; you can expect these temperatures to be down to 30 m. In Late May, I was diving with only my UV-protected rashguard and leggings. If you need a wetsuit, a 3 mm will be enough. If you plan to go diving in the cenotes, take a 5 mm with you.\nRegarding marine animal migrations, the season fromNovember to Marchis good for spotting bull sharks and spotted eagle rays. I didn\u2019t see any of these in my two trips to Cozumel, but I saw a hammerhead shark in November. During this season, the currents are slightly stronger and pelagic fish love currents!\nMost Cozumel dive sites are on its southwest coast, facing the Peninsula of Yucatan. There thereefs are sheltered from the open sea. The channel formed by the island of Cozumel and the Yucatan Peninsula also explains the currents, hence drift diving.\nThis part of the reef forms the Cozumel Reefs National Park (Parque Nacional Arrecifes de Cozumel), covering about120 km\u00b2 since 1996. The protected marine area, home to 205 coral and 262 fish species, is also registered as aUNESCO biosphere reserve.\nIn my two trips to Cozumel, I explored 6 different dive sites. Here are my top 5 :\nI\u2019ll need another longer stay in Cozumel to bring a complete description of all the best dive sites of the Mexican Caribbean Island. Great excuse to return, isn\u2019t it?\nI had the pleasure of being picked up from the pier of my hotel bySharky\u2019s Scuba Cozumelevery morning. The local dive shop was recently established by local instructors and dive guides with more than10 years of experience diving in Cozumel.\nAfter a detailed dive briefing, entry is done with a back roll from their spacious boat. Even doing drift diving, there was no need for a negative entry in Cozumel. Underwater, they aregreat marine species spottersbut always show the example of approaching gently, keeping some distance and never touching anything.\nWhile the weather wasn\u2019t with us, they still tried their best to make their famous fancy fruit platter at the surface interval. The entire team is perfectlybilingual in English/Spanish. Please say hi to Walter on my behalf if you go with them. It\u2019s a family business, and I felt treated as such.\nThe price for a 2-tank dive trip with them, pick-up by boat and scuba gear included, is 83$ if you book at least 2 days. Note there is a 3$ daily fee for the National Park, which is included in their price.Nitrox is availableas an option for 10$ per day.\nChoosing where to stay will be mainly between the centre of San Miguel and the resort area down the southwest coast, where most dive sites are.The more south you go, the latest you can wake up in the morning to go divingsince the dive centres come to pick up guests at all the different piers hotel by hotel (that felt very luxurious to proceed this way, think about bringing a mesh bag if you have your own gear).\nHowever, the more south you are located, the more expensive the taxi rides to the centre are if you want to enjoy the lively centre of San Miguel and its excellent restaurants. If you plan to stay at your resort the whole time to chill, that\u2019s another story, but please don\u2019t forget to explore the island at some point.\nI stayed atEl Cid La Ceiba Hotel, a local Riviera Maya chain of resorts. This is one of the closest resorts to the centre of San Miguel de Cozumel. It was only a 100 pesos taxi ride away (about 5 $/\u20ac). The advantage of staying at a seafront like this one is the direct access to their pier for being picked up by scuba diving centres in the morning. The hotel is about30 minutes away by boat from the dive sites. The ocean-view twin room I shared with my dive buddy had two queen size beds. The bathtub and balcony were useful whenwe turned our room into a dive centreto rinse and then dry our scuba gear (fun video to watch on my Instagram!).\nI loved their breakfast options, so I made sure to wake up early enough to enjoy it all before diving. You can have a deliciouscooked breakfast with Mexican flavours(if you have never triedchilaquilesbefore, this is the place because theirs were fantastic) and/or indulge in theircustom waffle service(strawberries and cream, please!).\nI was not necessarily a fan of being so close to the cruise ship terminal, but I guess this was the price of being at a seafront resort at the perfect distance between the centre of San Miguel and the dive sites.\nOcean view double room prices at El Cid La Ceiba start from 120\u20ac a night with what they call the \u201cEuropean plan\u201d, which means breakfast only, but they also have all-inclusive options. If you are looking for a more authentic address in town, I found thiscosy vintage hotela few blocks away from the main square, from 63\u20ac a night for a private ensuite double room. Budget travellers can enjoy thiscool hostel with a poolin the centre of San Miguel, from 15\u20ac a night for a bed in a dorm.\nFor those who want to splurge with 5-star luxury, direct access to the sea and no view on the cruise ships, you can book at thePresidente Intercontinental Cozumel Resort & Spa. They are just a little bit further south, but not too much. Their private beach is also a great snorkelling spot to extend your underwater fun.\nTo learn more about travelling and scuba diving in Mexico, have a look at the following articles:\nIs something still missing from this article?

        "title": "Top 10 reasons to go diving in Amed while exploring Bali",
        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/diving-amed/",
        "content": "There is ahidden gem on the northeast coast of Balithat defies the notion that the island is now overrun with overtourism and traffic jams. Welcome to Amed\u2014a tranquil fishermen\u2019s village where life moves at a slower pace. Yes, it is a three-hour drive from Denpasar airport to reach it, and any loud music must stop by 11 pm, but that\u2019s precisely why people like me love it. Withnumerous dive sites from Melasti to Banyuning, stretching over 10 km of coastline, Amed must be on your itinerary if you are goingdiving in Bali.\nAs I\u2019m taking slow travel a step further, I decided to make it my regional base while exploring Indonesia and neighbouring Southeast Asian countries. Over a year, I had the opportunity to delve deep into what Amed and its surrounding province offer passionate divers seeking a genuine immersion into the Balinese culture. Turtles, nudibranchs and shipwrecks are just the beginning of why you shouldn\u2019t miss spending a few daysdiving in Amedwhile exploring Bali.\nDivingin Amedat a glance\nAmed might be theultimate spot in Bali to swim with sea turtlesdue to how easy it is to spot them. Whether scuba diving or snorkelling, you\u2019ll likely encounter one or more hawksbill or green turtles between 5 and 10 m deep. While turtles can be spotted all along the coast, the hotspots are at Pyramids (in front of Warung Bobo) and Lipah Beach (in front of Warung Indah). I\u2019ve had a 100% success rate at both locations up to now.\nTo maximize your chances, head out in the morning when turtles are most active, munching on seagrass and coral. If you\u2019re snorkelling and prefer calmer waters,Lipah Beachis a safer option with its sheltered sandy bay. It takes about 10-15 minutes by scooter from Central Amed, where Pyramids is located, but the latter is also a drift dive site for scuba divers with potentially strong currents (see below). You can go directly from the beach and swim out for a few minutes or hop on a traditional jukung boat for a reasonable cost. For those travelling without any diving or snorkelling gear, you can rent a kit easily everywhere near the water for 50,000 to 60,000 IDR (3 to 4 \u20ac). You can also book ahead aprivate snorkelling tour in Amedwith everything included,\nRemember, always respect marine life anddo not touch the turtles. They have a protective layer that shields them from parasites, and touching them can cause harm. They usually don\u2019t mind a friendly approach but keep a respectful distance. If you\u2019re hoping for a great photo, be patient. Wait for them to ascend to breathe at the surface every 10 to 15 minutes\u2014this is the perfect moment for that unforgettable shot.\nWith its sheltered bay near the centre of Amed, Jemeluk offers a mix of shallow coral reefs and a deep wall, making it by far the most popular dive site in Amed. Unfortunately, its easy access has led to issues with some snorkelers standing on corals and feeding fish, which harms the marine ecosystem. However, the local diving community is actively working oncoral propagation projectsto restore and protect the reef . The underwater temple stands out among the artificial reef structures, offering a unique and photogenic spot. While not an actual sunken Balinese temple, the elegant structure has become a thriving habitat for marine life and makes a photogenic background for scuba divers, as well as free divers who like using it for training as a reference point.\nDives in Jemeluk Bay typically start by reaching the sandy slopes between 10 and 20 meters and taking a right turn. This first part is home tolarge pink and orange gorgonians, some of the most beautiful I\u2019ve seen in the entire area, and here and there, sea anemones and their anemone fish. I also frequently crossed paths with peacock mantis rushing to go from one den to another.\nDepending on your certification level and air consumption, you can explore thewall that descends to 35 m. Most people explore the wall then the bay in two different dive. I went to the end of the wall twice, but the beginning is by far the most interesting, both for the topography and the marine life. However if you take the option of being dropped by a jukung boat at the end of the wall, it is worthy to stay in the shallower upper reef around 15 m deep before reaching the beginning of the wall and go deeper. Usually, the wall of Jemeluk is where I spotted the most interesting species in all of my dives : leaf scorpionfish, white-spotted boxfish, clownfish, a turtle once and my first juvenile batfish.\nOn the return ascent, you\u2019ll encounter the coral propagation structures.After a few fin kicks, the underwater temple will appear\u2014a fantastic spot for wide-angle underwater photography. On several occasions, I had schools of squids passing by at that level. And then from there, when we started ascending to the safety stop, I frequently saw nudibranchs mating : couples of hypselodoris (Tryon\u2019s and Bullock\u2019s) with their bright colour and patterns make a great macro photography subject. If you have enough air, you might also extend the dive to see the elegant Balinese statues where diamond fish, lionfish and batfish often hang around them. You can also decide to go back for another dive on the left side, but besides the statues, that\u2019s not my favourite.\nMy dive log in Jemeluk Bay:\nIf you thought the Liberty shipwreck was the only one in Bali, think again.Amed boasts two additional wrecks\u2014one real and one artificial\u2014each offering a different experience with plenty of marine life.\nLocated about a 20-minute drive from central Amed in the village of Banyuning, thissmall 20-meter-long WWII wreckrests between 5 and 10 meters deep, making it accessible for divers of all levels and snorkellers. While not much remains of the ship, the coral growth and marine life around the wreck are stunning. I particularly like the part below what\u2019s left of the hull and inside. This is where I found leaf scorpion fish of all colours and schools of ring-tailed cardinalfish each time.\nFollowing the wall on the left, which goes down to 30 m, is a haven for macro enthusiasts with many colourful nudibranchs. I found the reef on the shallow part above the wall highly photogenic for wide-angle pictures, with its giant gorgonians and barrel sponges. In a nutshell, this ismy favourite dive site in Amed.\nMy dive log in Japanese Shipwreck:\nFar less known, as most people don\u2019t stay long enough to dive more than the two most popular dive sites, Jemeluk and Pyramids, it ismy 3rdfavourite dive site in Amed. Located near the entrance of Amed, where the \u201cI love Amed\u201d sign is, it\u2019s a sandy slope great for macro combined with aspeedboat wreck, the Marina Srikandi. It might not sound like much, but what I saw during my dives there, besides the fact you usually have the dive site for yourself, was enough to make me love it. Each time, I found the tiny Costasiella \u201cgreen sheep\u201d, these tiny nudibranchs grazing on the fan green seaweed in the shallows. On the sandy slope between 22 and 25 m deep, I saw large Thecacera \u201cPikachu\u201d nudibranchs, the Pacifica and the Picta type, on each dive.\nBut the most exciting, besides the yellow snappers and batfish swirling around the shipwreck, was thetwo big frogfishhanging on the deck for the black one and on the ladder for the light pink one. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t see them the second time, but I\u2019ll look again. Because of the tight space inside, I don\u2019t recommend getting there, but there are enough open windows to pop your head and check if those frogfish are hiding between the seats.\nMy dive log in Ghost Bay:\nDiving in Indonesia is famous for its powerful drift dive and unsettling down and up currents. But if you\u2019restill working on getting the skills and experience to face these conditions safely without emptying your tank in 20 minutes, Amed will be ideal for you. Before heading to Nusa Penida or Komodo, a couple of dives in Amed\u2019s drift dive sites will help you understand how to position your body and carefully adjust your buoyancy in sustained but manageable currents.\nInitially, the idea of diving among concrete pyramids didn\u2019t excite me much. However,my first dive at the Pyramids completely changed my perspective. Before reaching the artificial structures between 18 and 22 meters deep, you pass through a gorgeous coral garden teeming with life. This area is a hotspot for sea turtles, which you can encounter during the descent and the ascent. Besides the turtles, the two friends who came diving with me there particularly loved the giant blue starfish all over the natural reef.\nThe Pyramids, installed over 25 years ago, have becomevibrant artificial reefs adorned with colourful gorgonians, feather stars, and soft corals. As you drift effortlessly with the current, you\u2019ll encounter lionfish, moray eels, and leaf scorpionfish. I even saw a baby white-tip reef shark once (I heard it is usual around March-April, and indeed it was during a dive in March). Large schools of yellow snappers and damselfish swirl around them and all around you while blue-spotted stingrays camouflage themselves in the sand. My highlight was spotting a pygmy seahorse hiding between the last two pyramids. Due to the currents, macro underwater photography is a real challenge to get a sharp picture. This is definitely a fantastic dive site with a little bit of everything for everyone. I would say it\u2019smy 2ndfavourite dive site in Amed.\nMy dive log in Pyramids:\nI only got to explore this one recently as it isnecessary to go with a boat following youas you end the dive down a cliff. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t skip it because the reef in Bunutan left a big impression on me. You can either board a jukung boat (2 divers per boat) at Jemeluk Bay or at Lipah Beach since it\u2019s right in between. The dive starts off the beach of Bunutan, below Waeni\u2019s Sunset Point. The boat ride with Mount Agung overlooking the sea is already a fantastic introduction to how pleasant this dive site is.\nOn both dives, we descended on a garden eel sandy patch around 10m, and right away, we saw sea turtles grazing around. As you reach the reef, it is cool marine critter after cool marine critter: ribbon eels (blue, yellow and black), laced moray eels, octopus and a leaf scorpion fish. Descending to the deepest point,the reef is mostly made of giant barrel sponges. Sure, you see beautiful pink ones all around Bali, but never had I seen so many forming an actual reef with gorgonians here and there. This dive site deserves to be in my top 5 for Amed.\nMy dive log in Bunutan:\nAmed is a paradise for macro enthusiasts, especiallybeginner underwater photographers looking to hone their skills. Dive sites like Japanese Shipwreck, Ghost Bay, and Jemeluk Bay are teeming with colourful nudibranchs, seahorses, and other fascinating critters. The critters here are often larger (5 to 10 cm) than the rare species found in Tulamben, making it easier to capture stunning images.\nHere are the species I found you can expect to find easily and which are not too small:\nI also had the occasionalpygmy seahorse(Hippocampus bargibanti) at Pyramids. Japanese Shipwreck is supposed to be a good spot for pygmy seahorses, too. Still, I found the specific gorgonian (Muricella plectana), checked it every time and never saw a trace of a pygmy seahorse in a year. Besides, I always foundgreen sheep(Costasiella Kuroshimae) at Ghost Bay. In both cases, you\u2019ll need some practice in underwater macro photography since these are tiny species. Marine species move and can be seasonal; ask your Balinese divemasters, and they\u2019ll know where to find what.\nDiving in Amed is predominantly shore-based, making it incredibly convenient todive throughout the day without rushing. With your gear loaded onto a van or truck at the dive centre, you\u2019re just minutes away from the min dive sites. This ease of access allows for up to four dives from morning to evening. Even drift diving can be shore-based, like in Pyramids, the dive centre\u2019s van just comes to pick you up a little bit further down the road.\nFrom Melasti to Jemeluk,the water entry is from the black sandy beach, making it particularly easy to get in if there are no big waves (which can happen during the windy season from June to September). From Bunutan to Banyuning, you must be more careful of the small round pebbles, like at the Japanese Shipwreck. They tend to roll below your feet, but it\u2019s never as hazardous as some dive sites in Tulamben. But even in that area, in the middle, you have Lipah Beach, which is perfectly flat and presents a surprising mix of white and black sand.\nDive centres typically providebooties and open-heel finsas part of their rental equipment, so whatever the dive site, you\u2019re covered if you\u2019re not travelling with your own gear (or you only have full foot fins). Note that from Lipah, dive sites tend to be explored by boat due to the currents progressively increasing in the direction of Gili Selang (Bali\u2019s easternmost point).\nNight divingis also a highlight in Amed, with sites like Melasti Beach and Jemeluk Bay offering fascinating nocturnal marine life. But the ultimate night dive site for people in the known is in front of Melasti Beach in Amed. My first attempt wasn\u2019t that successful, mainly because the navigation isn\u2019t straightforward. There is a long, shallow sandy bottom hardly deeper than 8 m, and it\u2019s easy to miss the slope if you don\u2019t fin kick enough far out. On my second attempt, it wasoctopus galore with a dozen of coconut octopusat all depths. Around 15 m deep, a thick rope is the ultimate spot for macro critters lovers, either nudibranchs, crabs or shrimps. There, I saw for the very first time a soft coral spider crab, also called the decorator crab.\nMy dive log in Melasti (Amed):\nWhile getting around Amed is not as easy as in the south of the island as the drivers\u2019 apps are not available (see below), diving logistics in Amed is a breeze. Whether staying in Melasti or Lipah, most dive centres will arrangetransportation from and back to your accommodation, making your diving experience hassle-free. Indeed, since most diving is shore-based, they all have vans or trucks available to offer this service for free.\nThis is a great way toexplore the area without additional expensesas you move from dive site to dive site (the diving area of Amed covers more than 10 km of coastline, without counting Tulamben). Note a short taxi ride in Amed usually costs between 100,000 and 200,000 IDR (6-12\u20ac), so for a return trip to the dive centre it\u2019s a significant saving.\nAmed and its surroundings offer some of themost spectacular views overlooking the majestic Mount Agung. Oriented to the northeast, it\u2019s not possible to see the sunrise or sunset fully in Amed. However, the red colours lighting Agung at dawn and the sun passing behind it, painting the sky pink and purple at the end of the day, definitely make up for it.\nAfter trying many caf\u00e9s and rooftops from Melasti to Bunutan, here are my top spots to enjoy this magical scenery:\nBut if it wasn\u2019t enough, only 30 minutes of driving around Amed, there are other stunning viewpoints of Mount Agung. If you\u2019re a confident driver with an international licence,rent a scooter and enjoy the journey through the Balinese countryside. Here are my favourites:\nAmed offers a peaceful retreat from Bali\u2019s crowded tourist hubs like Canggu, Uluwatu or Ubud. Unlike Tulamben, Amed provides abalanced mix of peaceful fishermen\u2019s villages with many restaurants, caf\u00e9s, live music venues, spas, and yoga studios along its coastline. If party animals might find it boring, those of us who are all about chilling peacefully at sunset with drinks on the beach will love it.\nFood-wise, my favourite localwarung(traditional restaurants) for the best Indonesian food at great prices are:\nFor sightseeing, Amed serves as a gateway to some of Karangasem Regency\u2019s stunning spots, here are my favourite places:\nFor those who decide a little longer and want a deeper dive into the local culture, don\u2019t miss thearrival of the fishermenaround 8 am, andsea salt makingon the beach from August to November; you might also go on a scooter road trip to the Gili Selang lighthouse (Bali Easternmost point), venture to thelargest traditional market of East Baliin Amlapura (Pasar tradisional Amlapura), or evenlearn how to write in Balinese Aksaraat the Lontar museum.\nNo, it\u2019s not a mistake: I didn\u2019t include Lempuyang Temple. Why? If there is an overrated spot in the area, this is the one. People come only here for a famous picture they want to reproduce and wait on average 4 hours for a reflection shot with the view of Agung between the temple\u2019s gate (if the weather is clear), which is not real. There is no pond; the reflection is created with a mirror. And the worst, after paying for parking, shuttle and entrance, you can\u2019t even visit further than the main courtyard. And by the way, feel free to skip Maha Gangga Valley and the Luwak Coffee Plantation; these are just tourist traps.\nAmed\u2019s proximity to Tulamben, just a 20-minute drive away, is a significant advantage. Tulamben is home to the famousUSAT Liberty shipwreck\u2014arguably Bali\u2019s top dive site. This WWII wreck sits between 5 and 30 meters deep and is accessible to divers of all levels. Diving here at sunrise or in the afternoon is recommended to avoid the crowds coming from all over the island every day.\nTulamben also offers exceptional macro diving sites like Melasti and Seraya Secrets, which are ideal for beginners in underwater photography. For experienced macro underwater photographers, sites like Batu Niti and Gerombong present a treasure trove of tiny and rare critters.\nBelow is everything you need to know toprepare for your diving trip to Amed: best season, water temperatures, best dive centres and where to stay.\nThe best time to dive in Amed is during the dry seasonfrom May to October, when water conditions are the clearest. However, Amed is a year-round diving destination. Even during the rainy season (November to April), the weather is generally warm, with occasional showers (usually more before sunrise and in the afternoon). Visibility typically ranges from 15 to 30 meters. Still, sometimes it can reach up to 40 meters, even during the rainy season (the best conditions I got was one day in March).\nWater temperatures rangefrom 26\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C; water is at its warmest from October to April and at its \u201ccoldest\u201d in July-August (which is also when the air is the coolest but at the peak touristic season). A rashguard or a 1 mm skin suit can be more than enough in the warmest period, but I enjoy my 3 mm full wetsuit when the water is around 26-27\u00b0C. Note that sometimes the currents bring thermoclines as cold as 23\u00b0C in the deepest parts.\nNow I got to be honest, transportation is the difficult point here. To get to and around Amed you have to choose between quick, cheap and safe. But I promise it is well worth the efforts. Here are your options:\nImportant Note: Speedboat connections to the Gili Islands from Amed have stopped due to safety concerns. The nearest harbour is now Padang Bai, offering departures to the Gili Islands, Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Penida, and Lombok.You can book here.\nDive Conceptsoffers training and guided dives at themost affordable rates in the area, including free pick-up andfree Nitroxfor certified divers. Their dive centre is in Central Amed, where most shops and restaurants are. It is a sister location to their main base in Tulamben, where they have their compressor and equipment. This particularity also explains why theyprimarily focus on diving at Pyramids and Jemelukin Amed and then they take people to their Tulamben dive centre for the Liberty shipwreck and macro diving spots. They offer free transportation with their minibus all over Amed and Tulamben. Note that if you want to pass some scuba diving certifications, their team of instructors is mostly French.\nFresh Finsis one of the newest dive centres in Amed, and as such, they did their best to bring something which wasn\u2019t really seen around Amed so far: a premium experience. Theirbeautiful dive centre in Jemelukfeatures a gorgeous bamboo structure below a big mango tree and a delightful pool dedicated to training (but also people chilling after their dive) in addition to spotless bathrooms and showers (not a given in Bali).\nFor those who want todiscover the dive sites of Amed beyond the sometimes too popular placeslike Jemeluk Bay, they will take you to the best dive sites away from the crowds from Amed to Tulamben. For night diving in Amed, this is also the best option. They offer free pick-up around Amed andinclude lunch and drinks in their 2-tank morning trips. Note that dive professionals from Divemaster and divers with their gear get a special discount. The owners are American and South African, so it\u2019s ideal for English speakers.\nYour choice of accommodation can impact your experience in Amed, be aware of the accessibility and walkability if you don\u2019t plan on renting a scooter. Here are my recommendations of the best value-for-money hotels I found:\nFor budget travellers,Kunara Homestayis an excellent option. I stayed here during my first week in Amed, paying around \u20ac16 with breakfast included, as I was looking for a house. The rooms are spacious and clean, with air conditioning, a clean bathroom (I promise this is not a given in Bali with budget accommodation), a desk and parking space\u2014a real commodity in Central Amed. The only thing missing was a fridge, but overall, it was great value. However, if you have problems sleeping due to the chicken and dogs, Central Amed might not be the right place for you.\nAnd if you are looking to spend even less, then you have a fewhostels around Jemeluk Bay, with dorms starting at 100,000 IDR (6\u20ac) per night.\nFor those looking to splurge, it is essential to note that luxury resorts in Amed are not really a thing. There are a couple of 4-star resorts, but most don\u2019t have the standard you would expect from such hotels. However, after visiting a dozen of resorts unannounced, I finally found one that was nearly up par with the type of luxury resorts I love in places like Ubud or Sidemen: thePalm Garden Resort. Like most modern resorts, you have to go a little further away from Central Amed in Lean, the village before Banyuning (Japanese Shipwreck), the most recently developed area. But if you are looking for a spotless place to stay in style, including maybe one of their beachfront villa with a private pool, it is well worth the 15-minute drive. The garden bungalows are also very stylish and in any case you have a direct access to the beach.\n\n",

        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/diving-similan/",
        "content": "Thailand, often celebrated as the land of smiles, is also a haven for nature lovers with its 156 national parks, including 9 marine national parks accessible to scuba divers. Among these, theSimilan Marine National Park, created in 1982, might be the most famous in the local and international diving community. Located along the Andaman coast, about 70 km off the coast of Khao Lak, the Similan Islands are recognised for their turquoise waters and coral reefs. Many scuba divers, like me, often hear aboutdiving in the Similan Islandsfirst due to the perspective of crossing paths with whale sharks in the famous Richelieu Rock. But did you know this dive site is actually part of another marine national park in Thailand? And this is only one of the key facts you must know when going diving in the Similan Islands.\nIt had been 10 years since my last visit to Thailand. Before, I had mostly visited Bangkok and Koh Tao (where I did most of my scuba diving training up to Divemaster). This time, I went on a1-month trip across Thailand, finallyexploring the Andaman Coast from Khao Lak to Koh Lanta, including a 4-day diving liveaboard in the Similan Islands. I share everything I have learned here so you can have the best possible experience whenplanning your diving trip to Thailand. I covered how to get there, where to stay, liveaboard versus day trip, and national park closure, so you have all the information in one place. Ready to explore one of the best dive spots in Thailand?\nDivinginthe Similan Islandsat a glance\nThe Similan Marine National Park isclosed from the 16th of May to the 14th of October every year. This annual closure allows the ecosystem to recover from the pressure of tourism at a time when it\u2019s not ideal to visit anyway.\nIt is important to note that therainy season in Thailandisn\u2019t all over the country at the same time. There are two rainy seasons. While the part of Thailand from Chiang Mai to Phuket via Bangkok (Northern, Central, and Andaman Coast) has its rainy seasonfrom May to October, the Gulf of Thailand (Koh Samui and Koh Tao) has its rainy season from October to January.\nRegarding the best diving conditions,water is at its clearest in the Andaman Sea from January to April. Note that the peak season to see whale sharks this year was in February, even if usually January to March is the season to have a chance to see them. In my case, I didn\u2019t see any, just one manta ray in Koh Bon.\nYou can expect warmwater temperatures, usuallybetween 26 and 30\u00b0C. I recommend a 3mm full wetsuit (the full wetsuit being in case you run into a jellyfish bloom). However, at the very beginning of the opening season of the Similan Marine National Park, from October to December, water temperatures can be significantly lower. Local divers on my liveaboard reported temperatures down to 21\u00b0C in December. Because of the currents, sometimes you can have a much colder thermocline coming from the depths. If you go diving at that time, maybe pack at least a hood, just in case.\nAccessing the Similan Islands usually startsfrom Khao Lak, and more specifically fromThap Lamu Pier, also known as Khao Lak Pier. Located about 65 km from the main Similan Islands, 55 km from Ko Bon, and 72 km from Ko Tachai, Thap Lamu Pier is the departure point for most boats heading to the Similan Islands.\nDistance to Thap Lamu Pier from nearby tourist destinations include:\nTravellers usually fly first into one ofThailand\u2019s international airports: Bangkok, Phuket or Krabi. To find at which dates you can find the best prices on flights, you can easily compare prices ontrip.com.\nRegularbuses from Bangkok to Phuket pass through Khao Lakalong the west coast. As the only direct flight from Bali to Thailand was Bangkok, this is what I did. The journey was 16 hours with a change or bus in Surat Thani. The first part was at night, as I took theVIP bus option(1435 THB \u2013 38 \u20ac), and I could get decent sleep while saving on a hotel night. The second part was a local bus with basic comfort. At least I could enjoy the beautiful views of Khao Sok National Park in the morning light between Surat Thani and Khao Lak.\nAfter my liveaboard, as we arrived late at night at Thap Lamu pier, I had arranged a taxi to go to Phuket (note to myself for next time, even if a tad more expensive, book through the liveaboard company to avoid unnecessary stress of someone complaining your boat is arriving too late). At least, at 11 pm, it only took 1h20 to reach Phuket Old Town. The next day, after a lovely morning walk, I could take a speedboat at Rassada Pier to reach Koh Lanta in 90 minutes via Koh Phi Phi.\nThe Similan Islands boast numerous dive spots across11 islands. The archipelago of the Indian Ocean includes nine numbered islands (they have Thai names too, but fun fact, the meaning of Similan in a local dialect is the number 9), plus Koh Bon and Koh Tachai:\nEach island offers unique topographical features, fromshallow coral gardensto steep drop-offs and giant boulders, catering to divers of all levels. From Similan Island No. 1 through Similan No. 9, the dive sites are primarily hard coral gardens, but the topography slowly changes to walls and deeper sandy slopes as you move towards the 9thisland.\nMy dive log in the Similan Islands:\nWhile not technically part of the Similan Islands, the islands of Koh Bon and Koh Tachai are included in the protected area of the Similan Marine National Park. In the end, they offered memy favourite divesofmy diving liveaboarddue to their impressive topography: an underwater waterfall in Koh Bon and pyramid-shaped rocks covered in large colourful gorgonians in Koh Tachai. If it was fantastic to spot a manta ray in Koh Bon, the schools of batfish, barracuda, and emperor fish in Koh Tachai left the biggest impression on me. Koh Tachai was also my favourite night dive, with lots of nudibranch species to spot in its shallow coral gardens.\nMy dive log in Koh Bon & Koh Tachai:\nAnd here is the biggest surprise of all: the most famous dive site of the area,Richelieu Rock, isn\u2019t in the Similan Marine National Park but theSurin Marine National Park, at the border with Myanmar. Numerous whale shark sightings are why it became famous in the first place. Although no whale shark decided to say hi to us during my dives, I have to recognise that Richelieu Rock is a one-of-a-kind dive site that almost has it all.\nThis giant twin pinnacle in the middle of the ocean, with only a tiny piece of rock above the surface, is traversed by nutrient-rich currents, hence thenumerous opportunities to encounter pelagic speciessuch as whale sharks. Still, if you don\u2019t have that chance like me, the shoals of emperor fish and jackfish swirling non-stop around Richelieu Rock are quite the sight that would impress any seasoned diver. In addition to mating giant cuttlefish, curious batfish and colourful angelfish, getting a closer look at the rock among the bouquets of bright-coloured soft corals, you might find rare nudibranch species or an entire family of harlequin shrimp munching on sea stars.\nMy dive log at Richelieu Rock:\nDivers can expect to encounter a wide array of marine life in the Similan Islands. The waters are teeming withschooling fish, green turtles and giant cuttlefish. Night dives add a new dimension to the experience, revealing creatures such as ornate ghost pipefish and various colourful nudibranchs.\nHere is the list of popular marine species usually found in the waters of the Similan Islands; I put a tick next to the ones I got to see during my liveaboard:\nNow, here is the list of theinteresting fish speciesI personally spotted during my dives from Similan Island no. 4 to Richelieu Rock:\nRegardingnudibranchs, here are the species I spotted with the kind help of the passionate Thai divers present on my Similan liveaboard:\nOnce in Khao Lak, visitors have two main options to explore the Similan Islands:\nWhen looking into the details,the liveaboard option is more economicalfor avid divers looking to maximise their time underwater. I chose the liveaboard option because there are too many dive spots within the Similan Marine National Park, andI wanted to see a little of everything, so the liveaboard was much better than doing even 2-day trips as they only have time to go to one specific location each day (and depending on the day of the week, you won\u2019t be able to choose). Then, when you add the marine park feeds and the accommodation cost in Khao Lak, it makes more sense to go for a couple of days (see below).\nIf you have never done a diving liveaboard before, the Similan Islands might be the best place in the world to get your first experience sincethe value for money is excellentand the diving conditions are accessible to any diver with at least 20 dives. Note thatbooking a liveaboard as a solo travelleris absolutely no problem. This is how I did it, and I was paired with another female diver (who became a friend!).\nDiving in the Similan Islands is surprisingly affordable when opting for a liveaboard.My 4-day liveaboardin January cost me less than 700\u20ac, including accommodation, all meals, unlimited soft drinks and snacks, and up to 15 dives. As someone who did her first liveaboard in the Galapagos, the price difference was quite a shock. Thailand must be one of the most affordable places in the world toexperience the fun of a scuba diving liveaboard. Besides, you can choose the length of your cruise to fit your budget. Here are a few examples to give you an idea:\nThese are the lowest prices I found for departures in November, but depending on the level of comfort, liveaboards in the Similan Islands can cost up to 2,500 \u20ac for an 8D/7N trip. To find the latest prices and last-minute promotion, checkliveaboard.com.\nNow, it is also essential to take into account the marine park fees to pay extra on top of the price of your dives:\nFor my 4-day liveaboard in both the Similan and Surin Marine National Parks, I was asked to pay 2000 BHT (about 53\u20ac) when I arrived on board in addition to what I had already paid.Make sure to have spare cash on you before boarding. Note that the price of the liveaboards does not include rental equipment.\nRegardingdiving day tripsto the Similan Islands, I checked the price lists of 6 reputable dive centres in Khao Lak, and I found prices go from 4,950 to 5,800 THB (130 \u2013 150\u20ac) for a 2-tank day trip. In all cases, don\u2019t forget to add 700 BTH (18 \u20ac) of marine park fees to the prices, which also do not include rental equipment.\nThe price depends mostly on where you want to go and the distance from Khao Lak:\nIf this is still too much money, consider taking asnorkelling day trip to the Similan Islands. Prices range from 3100 to 3690 THB (80 \u2013 100 \u20ac), averaging 3360 THB (90 \u20ac). The marine park fees to add to these prices is 500 THB (13 \u20ac). Whatever option you choose, make sure to book early, as there is a maximum number of permits per day.\nSoif you do the math, taking into account the accommodation (I paid about 40\u20ac per night in Khao Lak for a simple double room) and all the delicious food you get on board instead of going to the restaurant (my average light meal in Khao Lak was 120 THB \u2013 3 \u20ac, on the boat we were served food 5 times a day \u2013 got to love the pre-breakfast at 6 am), you\u2019ll quickly see how good value theliveaboards in the Similan Islandsare.\nThe Similan National Marine Park enforces specific regulations to preserve its unique marine ecosystems. Adhering to these rules is crucial for maintaining the park\u2019s natural beauty and supporting sustainable diving tourism. Here are the key rules and requirements for diving in the park:\nCompliance with these rules is a legal requirement and a responsibility all visitors share to protect the park\u2019s marine life. It\u2019s important to practiceresponsible divingby not touching or disturbing marine animals.\nBe warned:the park authorities actively monitor compliancethrough various means, including checking photos and videos. Given the number of divers with cameras in the waters of the Similan Islands, any images showing a diver disturbing or harming marine life can be used as proof. Not only,a diver was recently fined for disturbing a whale shark by pulling its fin, with evidence gathered from social media. Honestly, I\u2019m impressed, big thumbs up to Thailand!\nWhile the Similan Islands are famed for their vibrant marine life, they also offerbeautiful landscapes for on-land exploration. I particularly enjoy Similan Island No. 8, where the iconic Sailrock viewpoint overlooks Donald Duck Bay. This spot offers spectacular panoramic views of the turquoise water bay lined by pure white sand.\nHere is another major benefit of doing adiving liveaboard: you can wait for all the day-trippers crowding the island to be gone toenjoy it before sunset. I made sure to be on the first dinghy to land on the beach and headed straight to the trail, climbing to the rock. I got it for myself for 15 minutes (not too bad, right?). The rest of the people who later joined weren\u2019t overwhelming, the atmosphere was friendly, and everyone was helping each other take pictures.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note thatovernight stays on the islands are no longer available. The bungalows and camping sites that once existed on Similan Islands No. 4 and No. 8 have been closed to help protect the island\u2019s fragile ecosystems. This move is part of broader efforts to preserve the natural beauty of the Similan Islands.\nTourism has significantly impacted the islands. In response to overcrowding, the number of daily visitors has been limited to 3,325, down from a previous cap of 3,850 and far below the daily visits that sometimes reached 7,000. Additionally, Ko Tachai has been completely closed off since 2016 to recover from the effects of over-tourism. For the latest information on visiting and protecting the Similan Islands, you can check theofficial national park page.\nKhao Lakserves as the primary base for trips to the Similan Islands; it offers a variety of accommodations ranging from budget guesthouses to luxurious resorts along its kilometres-long sandy beaches. The region has developed significantly, offering more upscale options near the dive sites and ensuring comfort and convenience for divers and travellers alike.Phuketis another option, but I recommend it more after the liveaboard due to the traffic and travel time.\nBefore setting off for the Similan Islands, you should take the time to explore Khao Lak and its expansive and pristine sandy beaches. The area\u2019s main road stretches over 40 km, but the real charm lies in the quieter side roads and coconut groves that lead to secluded beaches likeKhuk Khak Beach, Coconut Beach, and Nang Thong Beach, each offering a unique atmosphere and stunning natural scenery.\nDon\u2019t hesitate to rent a scooter to explore them all if you can. I loved Khuk Khak for its wilderness, Coconut Beach for its quiet turquoise waters and cosy beach clubs, and Nang Thong for the sunset by the lighthouse while surfers play in the waves. I had 3 days in Khao Lak and could have used a couple of extra days to visit the old town of Takua Pa or the Khao Na Yak National Park.\nI was glad I found theChu\u2019s Boutique Hotel, as most hotels were fully booked in January, which, weirdly enough to me, is the absolute peak season. The brand-new hotel looked like a small tropical motel with rooms around the pool just big enough to cool off. The private rooms were modern and spotless and included a kettle and a fridge, which, thanks to the 7-Eleven around the corner, was perfect for breakfast and even dinner once.\nFor those who want to splurge, I also had the opportunity to spend an afternoon at theAvani+ Khao Lak, whose restaurant had the best modern Thai cuisine I had tasted on my entire trip. Their premium offer includes front beach villas and suites with private swimming pools.\nOn my last day in Khao Lak, before boarding my liveaboard in the evening, I returned to my favourite beach, Khuk Khak, to see its northern part. I ended up drinking a coconut smoothie at the most gorgeous luxury resort in Khao Lak, theDevasom Beach Resort. If you\u2019re looking for true luxury with the most refined Thai style, this is where to go.\n100 km south of Khao Lak Pier, Phuket offers asurprising mix of vibrant nightlife and cultural heritage. Initially put off by Phuket due to the Patong area, I realised how big the island of Phuket actually is and how mistaken I was all this time in avoiding it.\nI stayed overnight in a small boutique hotel,Xinlor House, in the middle of the heritage shophouse district, packed with traditional and modern caf\u00e9s (I lovedRose Espresso Caf\u00e9&Bookhemian). Since I had only a morning to explore before boarding a boat to Koh Lanta, it was perfect to be 10 minutes walking from everything.",

        "title": "Diving in Malta: my top 5 dive sites all around the island",
        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/best-diving-malta/",
        "content": "Malta might be the smallest country in the European Union, but the southern Mediterranean archipelago has earned the title of thescuba diving capital of Europe. And it was by building up its dive map since the 1970s. Besides clear blue waters all year, the Maltese islands offer one of Europe\u2019s largest densities of shipwrecks and scenic cavern systems. Until recently, I would have agreed with European divers saying you don\u2019t godiving in Maltafor its marine life. However, my last trip surprised me with incredible encounters. It even included one I had been expecting for ages.\nOn mysecond trip to Malta in 2016, I discovered what the archipelago had to offer underwater while doing my wreck diving specialty, with 5 dives in Malta and 3 in Gozo. This time, motivated to complete all the adventures I had missed, I moved to Malta for two months. It gave me the time to dive deeper into each island of the archipelago. I dedicate this blog post toonly my dives in Malta and Comino, and I will do a separate blog post about Gozo. Between the end of April and the beginning of May, I went diving around the island to photograph all the best recreational dive sites (within amaximum depth of 40 m). As a bonus, I also had the opportunity to go boat diving in Comino Island, whereas diving in Malta ismostly shore diving.\nDiving in Maltaat a glance\n\nThis time, I logged 7 dives around Malta and 2 in Comino Island. There are three main diving areas around the main island:\nAmong my top 5 diving spots in Malta, please note some locations are suitable for beginners, and others are for advanced divers due to depth. Malta is also a paradise for tech and even rebreather divers, with some shipwrecks well below 100 m deep. For information, these historical wrecks can only be visited with accredited dive centres. Through them, you pay a fee toHeritage Malta, the governmental organisation conserving them.\nHere is a video summary of my dives in Malta:\nMy dive parameters:\nThe 1969 Libyan tanker wreck is undoubtedly thequeen of shipwrecks in Malta, at least among the ones accessible to recreational divers. I already loved it the first time I dived there in 2016. This time I got to appreciate its finest details with 3 long dives: the stern, the bow, and the engine room.\nLike many famous shore dive sites in Malta, the divers who prepare their gear efficiently will get the best parking spot. Why does it matter, you may ask?Shore diving in Malta often involves going up and down stairs and rocks. With about 30 kg of scuba diving gear on your back, the early birds can save a few extra efforts. In Zurieq, on the south coast of Malta\u2019s main island, visitors flock daily to board one of the traditional \u201cluzzu\u201d boats to visit the Blue Grotto. The Scuba divers water entry point is at the same spot down steep stairs with a plundging view of Filfla Island, an unhabited nature reserve.\nEven if scuba diving instructors will do their best to assist, don\u2019t underestimate the fitness level you\u2019ll need to comfortably climb back those stairs after 1 hour of diving. Whoever says scuba diving isn\u2019t a sport never shore dived in Malta! Once down the stairs, there are about10 to 12 minutes of swimmingto reach the nearest part of the shipwreck. Due to the traffic of the boats going to the Blue Grotto, the swim is done between 5 and 10 m underwater. It\u2019s easier than battling waves at the surface fully equipped, but remember, you\u2019ll do it twice.\nFor the first dive, I focused on the closest part of the shipwreck but also the deepest: the stern and the propeller. As I went down to 35 m deep to take pictures of thegiant propeller on the white sandy bottom, it meant not enough non-deco bottom time to penetrate the rooms above the stern. Remember, you have a total 20-minute swim time, and at 36 m, you have a maximum of 11 minutes before hitting decompression. So, if you are spending a bit of time on pictures like me, better to slowly ascend along the hull and finish by going around the giant chimney at about 20 m.\nAt the end of every dive on the UM El Faroud, the exit procedure is to take a left turn from the stern to reach the wall of the shore. This way, you swim between 15 and 12 m for the first half and around 7 m towards the end. All this while looking for cool marine critters such asoctopus, cuttlefish, flying gurnards or moray eels. Once back in the cove for the safety stop, open your eyes between the ropes of the boats. This spring, we got an impressivemauve stinger bloom(jellyfish), but my favourite moment was when I finally got to see ajohn dory, a fish I\u2019ve been searching for more than 10 years!\nFor the second dive, I went all the way to the bow. There are at least 15 minutes of swimming, as you must go over the 110 m shipwreck.Halfway, you\u2019ll notice thesplit where the ship broke into two partsdue to a storm in Zurieq and not the initial explosion in 1995 in Valletta. At this point, exploring what is hiding inside the shipwreck is tempting. But because of the long swim and if you want to enjoy the view of the bow from the sandy bottom at 29 m, there is no time for this. The UM El Faroud is all about choices and clear objectives.\nI returned another day to finally explore the wreck\u2019s most fascinating rooms: thekitchen and the engine room. The first one is easily accessible at 26 m; it\u2019s the first door you\u2019ll see on the starboard of the stern. A (bit rusted) mixer by the side of the sink makes an amusing picture with a diver in the frame.\nMy favourite, though, was definitely the engine room. Make sure to follow your guide. The engine is at 31 m deep, and there is a bit of penetration down some stairs to get there. Another pointyou want to be sure of is to know how to properly frog-kick with your fins, or you might ruin the view for everyone else to see the impressive 12-cylinder engine. The jumble of pipes and valve wheels around it will delight the most demanding rust lovers.\nGiven the depths of the different points of the shipwreck, even the \u201cshallowest\u201d (25m), sorry, but this wreck dive is only for advanced scuba divers.\nMy dive parameters: max depth 36 m \u2013 dive time 46 min \u2013 water temperature 17\u00b0C\nI can barely believe I missed diving in Cirkewwa the first I went scuba diving in Malta. I loved it so much that the only reason the P29 shipwreck is coming second after the UM El Faroud is primarily due to the impressive size of the latter. The dive site environment of Cirkewwa, at thenorthwest tip of Malta Island, is beautiful, with a great variety of rock pools, walls, seagrass meadows, caverns, \u00a0sandy bottoms and many potential marine species encounters.\nThe P29 is a formerpatroller boat which used to belong to the army in Malta, but it originally belonged to the German Navy before being sold in 1997. She served until 2005, when the Malta Tourism Authority bought to make it an artificial reef. The shipwreck stands perfectly right on a sandy bottom at 36 m deep, so it\u2019s a fantastic recreational wreck dive for advanced divers.\nAn advantage Cirkewwa has over Zurieq is how much easier is the water entry:far fewer steps from the parking lot and about half the swimming distance. I was promised 5 minutes of swimming, but I feel it was more like 7 or 8 minutes. Since you can\u2019t see the shipwreck from the shore, carefully taking the correct bearings or following your guide is essential.\nBeing a relatively deep dive, I\u2019d recommend going directly at the bow, the furthest and deepest point (36 m). The ship is52 m long, so it takes about 3 minutes to swim from one end to the other. The view of the bow from the sandy bottom is incredibly photogenic. No wonder this is where I took the cover picture of this article! Then, you can explore the rest of the shipwreck level by level. Check the upper deck with its fake machine gun (made of car parts), then the cabin and finish with the mast. A bell has recently been added, so you can use it to celebrate any scuba milestone with your buddy or your instructor.\nBy diving in spring, besides Susie\u2019s Pool (the entry point) being filled withmauve stingers, I couldn\u2019t help but notice an impressive number of long white pouches hanging on different parts of the shipwreck. These weresquid eggs! Depending on the larvae\u2019s maturity, you might see the baby squids inside by shining a dive light at the egg.\nWatch your dive computer throughout this dive andanticipate how your non-deco time will drop or recoverto optimise your bottom time. As for the UM El Faroud, there is still the return swim to make.\nMy dive parameters: max depth 33 m \u2013 dive time 44 min \u2013 water temperature 17\u00b0C\nThis British tugboat from 1958 was scuttled in Cirkewwa in 1992. She is 40 m long, and like its neighbour, the P29 shipwreck, she is standing straight on the sandy bottom. While its engine and propeller were removed before the scuttling,its anchor, about 30 m away, made this shipwreck one of the most iconic in Malta, more than the ship itself sometimes (I have to say the bulky style of the bow doesn\u2019t help).\nI found manysquid eggsagain, especially on the anchor! Be careful about the additional swimming time to the anchor, another 2 to 3 minutes, considering that the anchor is still pretty deep, at 32 m. While swimming from the bow of the Rozi to the anchor, scan the sandy bottom because you might find some interesting marine critters. That\u2019s how I spotted asizable white monkfish! The joke goes that I was pretty sure I had seen a stargazer. The reason was mostly because I had never seen a white monkfish; they were pretty dark brown in Catalonia! Obviously, from 30 m, there is always the doubt of some level of narcosis messing with your fish ID skills. At least I had the picture on my camera to confirm.\nMy dive parameters: max depth 19 m \u2013 dive time 57 min \u2013 water temperature 18\u00b0C\nSince I wentboat diving in Cominofrom Malta, I thought it was fair to put it here. Beginners/Open Water divers will be pleased to hear that I\u2019m finally adding a dive site they can explore to this list. Not only the maximum depth of 18 m is easy to respect, but as you have to do it from a boat, there is no sporty approach or a long swim.Here everything is easy,including excellent visibility of 20-30 m (The P31 shipwreck is the neighbour of the famous Comino Blue Lagoon). So, if you\u2019ve never done wreck diving before, this is the place to gain more experience.\nNow, does it mean it\u2019s a boring dive for experienced divers? Quite far from it! Thanks to its shallower depths and no swim time, you can spendan entire hour exploring all the details of the twin ship of the P29without worrying about your non-deco time or your air consumption. In my case, I took the opportunity of this long relaxing dive to bring my macro lens and spent a third of the dive on close-up shots of the pilgrim hervias and pink flabellinas roaming along the shipwreck hull.\nMy dive parameters: max depth 20 m \u2013 dive time 66 min \u2013 water temperature 17\u00b0C\nI am the first surprised that thistraining shipwreck in the urban area of Sliema, next to Malta\u2019s capital city, Valletta, made it to my top 5 dive sites list. But as I compared my pictures and notes, I couldn\u2019t reach another conclusion: This is a great dive site!\nDirectly accessible from the rocky beach of Sliema,next to Dive Systems Malta dive centre, the shipwreck is on the outskirt of Exile Bay. There is a fair bit of swimming, about 12 minutes. Still, it\u2019s such a beautiful and peaceful reef with a Posidonia seagrass meadow where Mediterranean damselfish swirl all around, and apparently, many octopus hide (well, apparently, extremely well).\nBecause it\u2019s an easy dive, it is often used for scuba diving courses. Indeed, I did one of my wreck specialty dives there in 2016, and I used it again this year as a check dive with my buddy who had never dived in Malta before. With a maximum depth of 18 m, it\u2019s aperfect dive site for beginnersand Open Water divers.\nOnce you arrive at the end of Exile Reef, where it takes a right turn, you should see the shape of the wreck appears. The shipwreck is not that big, 30 m long, so it only takes 2 minutes to go from the bow to the stern. So, with a pretty shallow depth, you have enough time to go 3 times around it. The most important is to remember toreturn to the reef at half tankbecause of the long swim.\nThe first time I dived this shipwreck, it had been recently scuttled, so the hull was pretty clean. 7 years later, the seaweed covers it, but if you know where to look, you can still see abeautiful Maltese cross embossedbelow the cabin on the stern side. This is a great dive for underwater photographers to adjust their settings at the beginning of any dive trip in Malta.\nNow you know my five favourite spots, I wanted to give you more information about the other dive sites I had the opportunity to explore and liked. I couldn\u2019t do two famous dive sites of Malta, two famous plane wrecks, the Blenheim Bomber and the Beaufighter. These two require booking a boat dive, and as these are not as often requested as the shore dive sites, I didn\u2019t have the chance to go. A reason to come back to Malta one more time?\nThe only WWII shipwreck accessible to recreational divers in Malta. The former British destroyer is so shallow that even beginner divers can explore it down the fortified walls of Valletta facing Sliema (it initially sank on this other side and was towed there). It was the final dive of my wreck diving specialty, but unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t much left of the ship. I think the most exciting was diving right next to the capital city of Malta.\nWas it because of the waves or because of a boat propeller? Anyway, 2 or the 3 caves located on the north shore of Comino had a milky water with a high density of white sand in suspension. Exploring them was impossible since the two first caves communicate with an underwater arch. The last one was clear, but there wasn\u2019t much to see except for a few nudibranchs and fan worms. I think my favourite part was navigating along the dramatic cliffs of Comino. It\u2019s a great dive for beginner divers who have never experienced cavern diving. Experienced divers won\u2019t be much impressed.\nThe dive site is 5-10 minutes driving a bit further away down the south coast after the Blue Grotto, in Siggiewi, near the Xaqqa Cliffs. A bit of a slope to access the pretty entrance pool. As we penetrated the cavern system, I was first excited by the tight entrance and beautiful rays of sunshine (note there was always an easy exit to the surface at any point). But in like 5 minutes, we were outside. I thought, \u201cThere must be another part\u201d; no, that was it. We finished the dive above seagrass meadows, where we saw nothing special.\nMalta is the southmost island of Europe between Sicily and Tunisia. ItsMediterranean marine lifeis representative of what can be seen in Spain, France and Italy, and not like Greece or Turkey, like one might think. However, no underwater forest of red and yellow gorgonians or large groupers in Malta but a wealth of shipwrecks and caverns. This being said, a john dory, a splendid fish I had been looking for everywhere from Scotland to Spain finally showed up at the safety stop of my final dive at the UM El Faroud; for sure, one of my most memorable underwater encounters.\nI summed up below the mostcommon fish speciesI saw in the waters of Malta, from the most common to the one-time encounters. I included those I saw in Comino and Gozo, as you will likely see them all around the archipelago.\nFrom anudibranchpoint of view, Malta is a surprising paradise for underwater macro photographers. They seem to love both caverns and shipwrecks. Spots the seaweeds and hydroids moving with the currents, and you\u2019ll find them.\nOthernotable marine specieswhile diving in the Maltese islands:\nImportant note about the fireworms: they\u2019re pretty with their bright orange colours (cf. top picture of this section), but make sure you never touch those! Their name is the warning. Their sting doesn\u2019t hurt, it burns! There is an incredible amount of them on every dive site. Besides, these little sneaky b******s tend to fall from walls or shipwrecks on your hands or neck, so always carefully approach any surface underwater.\nIt took me 3 trips to Malta, but I got it right this time! I now have the perfect place to stay in Malta, and on top of this,one of the best dive centres on the islandwas just down the road from where I stayed: I\u2019m talking about Sliema.\nIn only 10 minutes, I could walk toDive Systems Maltaat the end of Exile Bay. Their dive centre includes a large dive shop (if you need to buy or replace any piece of gear, they have everything) on the top floor with a classroom for people in training. The floor below is the locker room, with all the rental gear and compressor room. For people like me coming with their own scuba gear, there is plenty of space to store all your equipment for the time of your stay.Each diver is assigned a box with a numberand a rack for the wetsuit with the same number. So, plenty of room to change, lockers to keep your valuables safe and warm showers, what else to ask?\nAs most of the diving is shore diving in Malta, we usually prepared our boxes at the meet-up time, generally 8.30 am. Then everyone with their instructors loaded the tanks and the equipment boxes on one of the trucks or vans of the dive centre.Every day you might visit a different corner of the island for the price of your dive. If you\u2019re going boat diving to Comino, you\u2019ll join their sister dive centre,Starfish diving, in St Julians which has its own quay.\nNote to all tech divers that Dive Systems Maltacaters to advanced gas mixes, DPV and CCR divingand is one of the approved dive centres to explore the deep historical shipwrecks around the island. Their boat is licensed with Heritage Malta.\nYes, it is! If you consider passing your Open Water certification to become a scuba diver, go for it. Thanks to a great choice ofaccessible shore diving sitesand the range of depth available, it is less stressful to learn basic skills.\nThe best locations for beginners are located inSliema (Tugboat II) and Marsaskala (Tugboat 10, St Michael tugboats). These dive sites are shallow enough for beginners. The advantage of shore diving is that you won\u2019t risk seasickness, have more space to prepare your gear, and can remain as shallow as you feel comfortable. Note some shore dive sites in Malta sometimes require a sporty approach, on land or swimming, but this is not the case for the dive sites above.\nFor Open Water divers looking toexpand their dive skills, Malta is a great place to experience deep diving, wreck diving or cavern diving. I did this on my first dive trip there; I passed my wreck diving specialty.\nThe scuba diving season in Malta is usuallyfrom March to November, but several dive centres remain open all year long. With anaverage water temperature of 20\u00b0C, you can dive in Malta in a wetsuit anytime. Even in the winter, with stronger winds, thanks to its numerous shore dive sites around the island,scuba divers can find a sheltered spot every day.\nThis time, I scuba dived inspring when the water is nearly at its coldest. From the end of April to the second half of May, I saw the temperature increase by almost 1\u00b0C every week. Sometimes, the wind could bring back colder water, but I went from16\u00b0C to 19\u00b0Cin 3 weeks. Bringing a semi-dry suit was an excellent choice for this level of temperatures.\nThe first time I dived in Malta was at the end of July. That year water temperature was colder than usual, with a temperature around 20\u00b0C. I wore a 5 mm full wetsuit with a hood, gloves and booties with a warm undersuit below, and I still felt a bit cold. Usually,in the summertime, water temperatures are 24 to 25\u00b0C.\nIf you are looking for the warmest water and the best visibility while enjoying a shoulder season, thenSeptember is the best time to dive in Malta. Water has heated up all summer with amaximum water temperature around 26\u00b0C, and you can dive without the crowds and with lower accommodation prices.\nOnce you\u2019re in Europe, getting to Malta couldn\u2019t be easier. There aredirect flights from virtually every main city in Europe. I flew from Paris and flew back to Marseille! Plenty of options from the UK, with flights from all London airports, but also Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and many more. You\u2019ll find something similar for Germany, Spain, Italy, and many other European countries. To find at which dates you can find thebest prices on flights, you can easily compare prices ontrip.com.\nIf you don\u2019t feel like flying, there is a possibility of going there byferry from Palermo or Pozzallo in Sicily, Italy. To get there, note there is anight train going from Rome to Palermo, Sicily(including an incredible cross-over of the Messina Strait of the train on a ferry, yes, you read correctly). As you can see, I looked into the details, but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t make it this time.\nNo hesitation this time, stay away from Saint Paul\u2019s Bay andstay in Sliema. It\u2019s central, next to Valletta, with plenty of yummy and reasonably priced restaurants, direct access to a lovely long seafront promenade, and all the best dive centres are a short walk away. Since I was working remotely in Malta for an extended period of time, I rented an apartment for a month. However, for 2 nights before and after, I tried two different types of accommodation: a hostel and a luxury resort. This way, you can pick what fits your budget!\nAll adventurers deserve a treat! After a 2-week marathon of conferences and an intense week of wreck diving, when I gave back the keys of my flat in Sliema,I couldn\u2019t dream of a better place to staythan theAX Palace in the heart of Sliema. If you can, pay the extra to get a room on the upper floors becausethe views of Valletta from the balcony are incredible at sunrise and sunset. My room was incredibly tastefully decorated, and the bed was a dream.\nTheoutdoor rooftop poolwas the perfect spot for a refreshing swim and a cocktail. In the evening, the indoor pool, with its sauna and hammam, was the cherry on top of my relaxing stopover before moving to Gozo. While I wasn\u2019t too impressed with the breakfast, book a table one night at their Asian restaurant on the rooftop next to the pool. Whether you like eating Thai, Indian, Japanese, or a mix of everything, they have it all, and it tastes as it should, and the service is top-notch. Top tip, when booking the table, ask for a table near the windows with views of Valletta.\nWaiting for my flat to be available, I booked 2 nights in ahostel in St Julian\u2019s near Sliema. I thought it was the best way to start my stay in Malta as hostels are usually fantastic places to meet with other travellers and gather valuable tips.\nAnd this is precisely how it went atMalti hostel. I must admit, I picked this one because they also offered private rooms at a great price (40\u20ac a night in April), it was close to Balluta Bay, and they have a jacuzzi on their rooftop. Well, I discovered later the water of the jacuzzi was pretty cold, and in the chilly temperatures of April, I couldn\u2019t stay longer than 5 min! Anyway, I love thecosy living room and kitchen that worked perfectly to socialise with the other guests, even if my room was in another building, but literally next door.\nIs something still missing from this article? Do you have any questions?\nPlease let me know in the comments, and I\u2019ll do my best to help!",

        "title": "Should you swim with whale sharks in Isla Mujeres, Mexico?",
        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/swim-whale-sharks-isla-mujeres-mexico/",
        "content": "For many passionate scuba divers,encountering a whale shark, the largest fish in the world, is their absolute dream. I was one of them. These gentle giants of the sea evoke a deep sense of wonder and respect. However, swimming with these elusive creatures is not an easy feat.\nCrossing path with whale sharks underwater is oftena journey filled with anticipation, patience but also, sometimes, disappointment. One question arises: should this encounter come at any cost? As I witnessed respectful encounters with whale sharks in Utila and the Galapagos, my concerns grew when I learned about the proximity of the famous Yucatan whale shark gathering to Cancun, the bustling temple of mass tourism in Mexico.\nThe promise ofhundreds of whale sharks gathering off the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsulais undeniably enticing. Regulations and guidelines attempt to ensure responsible interactions. Yet, the price tag averaging 200 USD raises important questions. Where do we draw the line between protecting whale sharks and fostering local economic development? I headed to Isla Mujeres to unveil the realities of swimming with whale sharks. Here is how it went.\nTiming is crucial when planning a whale shark adventure in Isla Mujeres. The whale shark season usually runs fromJune 1st to September 15th, aligning with their annual migration. Note the official dates in 2022 were from May 15thto September 17th. Any tour outside of these dates is considered illegal. However, the chances of seeing whale sharks at the beginning and the end of the season dramatically drop.\nI went at the beginning of June, on the 10thto be exact, and we searched for 3 hours to finally find 2 whale sharks. July is usually the peak season, with gatherings allegedly up to 100 individuals (but I can\u2019t confirm this information).\nEveryone goes tothe same spot wherever you book your whale shark tourin Yucatan, Mexico. That was one of my key findings. There isn\u2019t an area in Cancun, one in Holbox and one in Isla Mujeres. There is one deep-water area between Isla Mujeres and Hoalbox, East of Isla Contoy, which is significantly closer to Isla Mujeres (about 35 km). Note there was originally another smaller congregation of whale sharks off Cabo Catoche in Holbox, which was turned into a protected area, theWhale Shark Biosphere Reserve. But this is not where the tours take people anymore, even from Holbox.\nThis area was nicknamed \u201cAfuera\u201d by the local fishermen who first spotted it in the early 1990s (tours started about 12 years later). \u201cAfuera\u201d means \u201cfar out there\u201d: you need 1 to 2 hours of bumpy navigation heading North from Isla Mujeres. If you are prone to seasickness, you should stock up on motion sickness pills. The proximity to Isla Mujeres explains this is where you can find the best deals; the lowest price I found was 150 USD (you won\u2019t see these tours advertised in Mexican pesos).\nWhale sharks gather in large numbers due toabundant fish eggsfrom spawning Little Tunny or Bonito, a small Atlantic Tuna species, in the summer when water temperatures reach 25\u00baC. The bonito eggs found at the Afuera attract many whale sharks to feed, way more than the concentration of zooplankton can apparently at Cabo Catoche, in Holbox.\nFor information, I booked with a dive centre in Isla Mujeres, but the operation was subcontracted to another business. This is the usual practice in Isla Mujeres;you rarely meet the person you are booking with. Dive centres act only as travel agents in this case.\nButpeople come from all over Yucatan. On my boat, we had a group who came from Cozumel. They woke up at 5 am that day and still arrived late because they missed the ferry from Cancun to Isla Mujeres because their ferry from Cozumel to Playa del Carmen was delayed. Coming from Cozumel with all the included pre-transportation can go up to 400 USD per person.\nPreserving the well-being of whale sharks and ensuring sustainable tourism practices necessitate the implementation of regulations and guidelines. From that point of view, the Mexican government did the job by puttingrules for the whale shark tours of Isla Mujeres. When I boarded the boat, I was pleased to see aposter recapitulating the rules of swimming with whale sharksin Mexico.\nThe main rules are as follows:\nAs you will see, almostnone of these rules were respectedduring the tour I joined and anyone who joined a tour that day anyway. At this point, it\u2019s also important to highlight that some of the waters around Isla Mujeres are part of a national park: Parque Nacional Isla Mujeres-Cancun-Nizuc. However, it only includes the West Coast of Isla Mujeres. The same applies to the Isla Contoy National Park. The whale shark gathering area, the Afuera, is not even included in the Whale Shark biosphere reserve created off Cabo Catoche in Holbox. Still, it apparently belongs to theBiosphere Reserve of the Mexican Caribbeanwhich covers the rest of the shore of the peninsula. But for what level of protection ?\nI knew it was thevery beginning of the season. Unfortunately, despite having 6 weeks tovisit Yucatan, I had a flight taking me to the Galapagos, where I had booked a liveaboard, so it wasn\u2019t possible to wait for more. Our captain said they didn\u2019t see any the day before, but they could see a couple of whale sharks earlier that week. I was very well aware I could potentially spend hours at sea and see nothing. But I was willing to take chances. It\u2019s how nature works, right?\nWe left Isla Mujeres from one of the piers of Playa Norte at 10 am, waiting for the group arriving from Cozumel about an hour later than planned. In a way, ourdelayed arrival in the Afueramight have been beneficial if we knew where to go since boat captains from different operators help each other. As we headed North, the calm turquoise waters of Isla Mujeres were quickly replaced by deep blue waves.\nI don\u2019t take chances anymore now: I\u2019m glad I took that motion sickness pill with my coffee that morning.The ride was bumpy for 2 hours, looking endlessly and unsuccessfully to the horizon in the middle of the ocean. Then the captain got a message on the radio that others spotted a couple of whale sharks quite the opposite direction of where we went. On board, all passengers were cheering the captain, asking to go even if some of them started to be badly affected by sea sickness.\nObviously, this is what all the other boats did. Talking with our captain while we made the run for our last chance,I eventually learned that 300 official boat licences existed. 300! And wait, this is without counting the \u201cpirate boats\u201d operating illegally. When you later learn that the area we were scouting is about 18 km\u00b2, that sounds a tad much, even if the maximum of 120 boats in the area was respected. And so, 30 minutes later, here we were, together with 33 other boats with 10 passengers on each. Two whale sharks were swimming among the boats for more than 300 swimmers to wait to go in the water. This is when the rules face reality.\nThe boats positioned themselves into swirls to form a waiting line. The only rule applied that day (at least on our boat) was thatno more than 2 swimmers (and their guide)could be in the water with a whale shark. After one boat dropped a team of swimmers and got them back, about a minute later, it had to return to the back of the line. We did it 5 times, giving each buddy team less than a minute in the water for a much-awaited encounter.\nWhen it was our turn, my buddy and I positioned ourselves at the back of the boat, waiting for our guide\u2019s signal to drop us a few meters in front of the route of the whale sharks. 1, 2, 3,we glide into the water with as little splashing as possible. The boat\u2019s edge was quite high, so it\u2019s not easy if you\u2019re not an experienced diver/snorkeler.\nWith so many boats around, dropping the swimmers close enough to the whale sharks but ensuring they\u2019re safe from the other boats makes it virtuallyimpossible to respect the minimum distancewith them. Here I was in the water, facing the most adorable of the sea giants. When you see images of them, they look like they\u2019re slow, but they\u2019re not. So in seconds, the distance we tried to maintain was a mere memory as the whale shark swam right by us. We had to swim back to let it pass but still got hit by its caudal fin (no harm, no worries, I was more worried about the shark).\nThanks to the clarity of the water, we had another moment to watch it swim away peacefully. And that was it.4 hours at sea for 30 seconds in the water. I\u2019m immensely grateful every time I\u2019m in the presence of these incredible marine animals. But the reality struck back when I came back on board in the swirl of boats.\nBeing the closest inhabited area to the Afuera,Isla Mujeres offers the ideal base to swim with whale sharksthanks to its white sand beaches, hotels and restaurants\u2026 in theory. I didn\u2019t go to Isla Mujeres on my first trip to Mexico as I tried my best to avoid Cancun\u2019s craziness. But for 12 years, I kept hearing friends saying they loved it. I thought, OK, worth giving it a try.\nAfter returning my rental car from Valladolid, I took the bus from Playa del Carmen to the central bus terminal of Cancun. Crossing the centre of Cancun this way was enough to reinsure me that this concrete jungle is not a place I ever want to spend time in. Then I needed to join theferry terminal at Puerto Juarez. I could have done it by taking another bus, but it started to be quite late, so I took a taxi in 10 minutes for 100 pesos. Crossing to Isla Mujeres takes 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on whether you take the fast or slow ferry.\nI only had 2 days to explore the northern part of the island and go on the whale shark tour. OK, maybe I missed something by not going to the south of the island, but at this point, I was done. On the first day, I spent half of my time at Playa Norte, which is, without a doubt,the most beautiful beach I\u2019ve seen in all of Yucatan. Especially since I was right in the sargassum weed season, and Isla Mujeres remains unaffected by these.\nUnfortunately, despite all the signs, the sand is oftentrashed with plastic cupsfrom people buying drinks from nearby minimarts. With my buddy, we went as far as cleaning a group\u2019s mess at sunset between abandoned cups, bottles and plastic bags of ice. But the most discouraging was seeing it everywhere we walked around the island, the worse being maybe the Malecon (seafront promenade) on the east shore. But if it wasn\u2019t enough, when we decided to walk along the west shore to take pictures of the whale shark monument, there was thispermanent smell of petrol in the airto the point of giving you a headache. You would think Isla Mujeres would be an eco-friendly destination with all its golf carts, right? Except none of them are electrical!\nMost beautiful beach, maybe, but Isla Mujeres is now atemple of mass tourismwith visitors who only care about drinking and partying. At leastthe hostel I stayed at had fantastic chilled vibes. While being super central, it was quiet and even offered breakfast in the morning, which was a great moment to meet the other guests.\nUnfortunately, it was not enough for me.I won\u2019t come back. There are many other places I want to explore in Yucatan, such as Merida or Banco Chinchorro. I might even give Holbox a chance. It is way more expensive than Isla Mujeres accommodation-wise, but at least it looks more preserved.\nFor once, here are some good news. In 2016, whale sharks were registered as an endangered species on theIUCN red list. In 2021, a new study showed a global improvement of their population now classified as depleted with arecovery score of 29%. It doesn\u2019t mean of course, we should stop protecting them. It shows with adaquate conservation measures (especially fishing and bycatch), we can help them reaching a healthy population across the ocean.\nIf you search online, you will likely find very little contentdiscussing the responsability of shark encounter experiences, whether we talk about whale, white, tiger, bull, or hammerhead sharks. Somehow the worst is within our ocean community, where this is still a huge taboo. Why? Because these \u201cecotourism\u201d tours often mean big money for fishermen communities who sometimes just survived before these tours started.\nI often heard that if more people can meet sharks underwater, they won\u2019t see them only as a terrifying predator and will help their plight. I also heard when fishermen communities realisehow much sharks are worth alive compared to deadto sell their fins, it can then save the sharks. But if these tours are out of control, is this a happily ever after for the whale sharks in Mexico?\nWhat do you think? To read more about this topic, look at my article after meeting my firstwhale sharks in Utila, Honduras or mydiving liveaboard in the Galapagos.",

        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/diving-menjangan-bali/",
        "content": "Nestled off its northwestern coast, Menjangan remainsone of Bali\u2019s most underrated dive destinations. Often overshadowed by more popular and more easily accessible diving spots such as Tulamben or Nusa Penida, Menjangan offers a tranquil escape with turquoise waters and vibrant coral gardens. Any underwater adventurer should make the effort to drive a little further and put the tiny island on the itinerary when goingdiving in Bali. Besides, Menjangan is part of the West Bali National Park,Indonesia\u2019s oldest national park: its reefs have been protected for over a century. The extended travel time and the historical protection have made Menjangan a fabulous place for marine biodiversity enthusiasts who love having the spot almost to themselves.\nI had the opportunity to explore Menjangan both underwater and on land in 2015 and again in late 2023. Each of my visits offered complementary perspectives on the island\u2019s beauty and natural diversity. Menjangan ranks amongBali\u2019s best dive sites,boasting colourful giant gorgonians, pygmy seahorses and clownfish. The island\u2019s calm waters and shallow reefs provide ideal conditions for beginners, while its deeper walls are all aboutdrift divingfor advanced divers.\nMenjangan Island also features an intriguing terrestrial aspect. Its name in Indonesian means \u201cisland of the deer\u201c; indeed, its namesake deer can be spotted sunbathing on its beaches or grazing on its cliffs. This unique blend of natural wonders above and below the sea underscores why Menjangan should not be overlooked when planning a dive trip to Bali.\nDivingin Menjangan Islandat a glance\n\nEstablished in 1917 andofficially designated as a national park by the Indonesian government in 1941,West Bali National Park(Bali Barat) encompasses approximately 190 km\u00b2, representing about 5% of Bali\u2019s total land area. It remains to this day, the only national park in Bali. It starts after Pemuteran and stops before Gilimanuk (where you can take the ferry to Java). Beyond its protection status, a distinct advantage of Menjangan Island is its distance and travel time from the crowded south of Bali. Hence, it remainsprotected from mass tourism.\nBali Barat National Park serves as a sanctuary for a broad array of wildlife, both marine and on land; it is also a popular spot for bird watchers in Bali. Menjangan Island, though just a tiny part of this extensive park, plays a pivotal role in the region\u2019s conservation efforts. The park\u2019s early establishment at the beginning of the 20thcentury has helpedsafeguard the island\u2019s coral reefs from the damage seen in other parts of Indonesia(ever heard of dynamite fishing orblast fishing?).\nThe waters surrounding the island are renowned for their crystal-clear visibility, often extending up to 50 meters in the dry season, allowing divers an exceptional view of the reefs below. This protected underwater ecosystem, whereover 110 identified coral speciesthrive, is arguably one of the best-preserved reef environments in Indonesia. Menjangan Island is a must-visit for those diving in Bali and an example of successful conservation practices in a world that desperately needs more of these sanctuaries.\nTheentrance ticket to the National Park\u00a0is 200,000 Rp(12\u20ac) since July 2014. The price hasn\u2019t changed since my first visit, but they introduced a higher fare on weekends and national holidays for foreigners, 300,000 Rp (17\u20ac). Scuba divers don\u2019t have to take care of paying the entrance fee, it\u2019s generally included in the price of their dives by the dive centre.\nMenjangan Island caters to all scuba diving levels, from beginners to advanced divers trained to descend to a depth of 40 m.The calm, sheltered waters around the island make it an ideal spot for Open Water divers and even enthusiast snorkelers, while the deep walls and thrilling drift dives attract experienced divers. Menjangan\u2019s dive sites are adaptable to different skill levels, as it is easy to limit the maximum depth while maintaining an interesting route with plenty of corals and marine wildlife to see. However, some dive sites may be more exposed to currents, but your divemasters will carefully pick suitable sites for the divers on board each day.\nThe island might only be 39km\u00b2, but it is surrounded by11 dive sitesthat are all more interesting than each other. You can drift dive, wall dive, deep dive, and if you are into underwater photography, you will just want more! Here are the 3 dive sites I  explored in 2015 and 2023:\nEach time, I went down at amaximum depth of 25 m(there is not really much to see below) and enjoyed leisurely drift dives for60 to 70 minutes. The boat picks you up at the end of the dive: there is no need to battle against the current as you glide effortlessly, adjusting the position of your body to the current to control your speed and give you enough time to see all the critters.\nEach dive usually starts by following a wall, going and reaching the deepest point agreed upon at the briefing.Between giant gorgonians and barrel sponges, you will likely cross paths with batfish, crocodilefish and frogfish. Getting closer to the gorgonians, I could see a denise pygmy seahorse and various nudibranchs. Then, we follow up a sandy slope inhabited by the garden and sand moray eels. In the shallows, the hard corals and sea anemones are full of marine life, especially clownfish and anemone shrimps.\nDive sites like Pos II, Coral Garden, and Eel Garden are renowned for theirmarine biodiversity. The island\u2019s underwater topography and gentle currents allow divers to combine a variety of dive environments in a single visit, such as deep walls, sandy slopes and coral gardens. My favourite encounter in Menjangan Island? The Denise pygmy seahorse, which I saw for the first time in nearly 15 years of diving.\nI summed up below thefish speciesI saw in the waters of Menjangan, from the most common to the one-time encounters:\nMenjangan, like many dive sites in Bali, is aparadise for underwater macro photographers. You\u2019ll likely find nudibranchs and pygmy seahorses by looking closely at gorgonians, sea anemones and sponges. Here are the species I saw in Menjangan, from the most common to the one-time encounters:\nMenjangan Island extends beyond its underwater treasures. During surface intervals, divers can explore the island, including the surroundings of aBalinese temple(the sanctuary is not open to visitors other than Balinese people coming to pray) and awhite sand beachnear the national park office with aview of East Java\u2019s volcanoes, especially Mount Ijen. The latter is where we had a picnic on my first visit to Menjangan Island. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen sand any whiter around Bali.\nThe island\u2019s south side near the temple is thebest place to spot the island\u2019s namesake deergrazing in the underbrush. This side of the island is mostly made of cliffs, so it offers quite the vantage point on Bali\u2019s northern shore. I noticed some deer coming to the jetty looking for freshwater as the island is rather dry, but please refrain from giving them food.\nBeyond the beauty of its landscape, it\u2019s impossible not to be struck by the intricately carvedwhite Ganesh templehanging above turquoise waters. The island also has a religious significance. Scuba divers and nature lovers are not the only ones showing up at the transfer jetty in Pelabuhan Lalang. Balinese people in traditional attire visit the island most days, bringing offerings and participating incultural rituals highlighting this sanctuary\u2019s spiritual importance. However, despite the numerous signs both in Indonesian and English prohibiting single-use plastics, we can only regret seeing these offerings are often packed in plastic bags that remain on the island.\nExploring Pemuteran\u2019s dive sites after visiting Menjangan Island offers a different diving experience that can be a valuable addition to your itinerary. However, Pemuteran Bay, known for itsmuck divingspots, contrasts sharply with the pristine conditions found in Menjangan. During my recent visit, I engaged in night diving at the Macro Jetty, explored the Biorock project in Pemuteran Bay, an initiative aimed at coral restoration, and tried diving Pemuteran outer reef at Pulaki Reef.\nTheBiorock project, in particular, shows successful colonization by diverse marine life, including batfish and sea turtles playing hide-and-seek among the structures inspired by the Balinese culture. On the other hand, I have to be honest: My favourite part of diving the outer reef of Pemuteran was the boat ride with the view of Bali\u2019s mountainous northern coastline.\nThenight dive at the Macro Jettyoffered a stark introduction to muck diving in Indonesia, reminiscent of the famous but heavily polluted Lembeh Strait in Northern Sulawesi. Despite the waste and debris, the dive revealed fascinating marine life, such as a juvenile coconut octopus, a light pink thorny seahorse, and arare butterfly nudibranch(Cierce Elegans) so transparent I didn\u2019t know where to set the focus of my camera!\nI summed up below everything you need to know to prepare for your trip to go diving in Menjangan Island: best season, water temperatures, best dive centre and the best places to stay.\nReaching Menjangan Island typically starts from Pemuteran, the closest hub with a range of dive centres, restaurants and hotels. Due to Menjangan\u2019s remote location, it\u2019s recommended that diverstravel to Pemuteran a day beforetheir dive to relax and start early the following morning.\nThe first time, I travelled to Pemuteran from Ubud, I took thescenic road through Bedugul, a highland area known for its cool climate and delicious strawberries. This route offers a refreshing stop and is the most direct route to the North of Bali. It took about four hours, including a short visit toPura Ulun Danu(which might be Bali\u2019s most famous postcard). Divers should note that this road should not be taken immediately after diving to prevent decompression sickness. Bedugul is at 1,500 m of altitude.\nOn my most recent trip, as I\u2019m based in Amed, I travelled to Pemuteran via thenorthern coastal road that passes through Singarajain 4 hours. Right after,Lovina Beachprovides a delightful break for lunch. The journey between Tianyar and Kubutambahan is particularly pleasant, with some nice views of the ocean. This alternative route is suitable for those planning to drive right after diving, avoiding high-altitude roads.\nOnce in Pemuteran, accessing Menjangan Island is straightforward. Dive trips usually begin early in the morning with a 30-minute drive toLabuhan Lalang Jetty, where the dive operators handle all park and boat fees. From there, it\u2019s a15- to 20-minute boat rideto Menjangan Island\u2019s first dive sites.\nTo get a complete diving experience in Bali and make the most of your time, anideal itinerary including Menjangan Islandwould start in Ubud upon arrival, then move to Pemuteran via the scenic Bedugul route, continuing to Amed or Tulamben for more diving adventures, and possibly concluding with a visit to Nusa Lembongan or Penida, accessible by ferry from Padang Bai. It is then possible to reach Sanur by speedboat, which is the closest to the airport.\nThe optimal months for diving at Menjangan arefrom May to October, during Bali\u2019s dry season when underwater conditions are at their best. However, the protective status of the national park means that Menjangan Island offers good diving conditions nearly all year round, with slightly varying visibility but remains always decent.\nThe first timeI went diving in Menjagan,it was in October and the visibility was fantastic. It was a little less true, especially in the deeper areas along the walls, when I returned diving there in late December. In both case, I always had warm water temperature with29\u00b0C on average.\nPemuteran, the closest access point to Menjangan, hosts severalreputable dive centres, withDive Concepts Pemuteranbeing a solid choice. They are conveniently located within the same building as Hotel Arjuna, enhancing the ease of your stay. The proximity to comfortable accommodations allows divers to relax fully before and after their expeditions. Their all-inclusive packages typically cover accommodation, breakfast, transfer by van to Labuhan Lalang Jetty, boat ride to Menjangan Island, lunch and diving and rental equipment.\nFor those planning a trip to Menjangan Island, staying overnight in Pemuteran and considering a local operator like Dive Concepts is much better than booking with an operator from the south of Bali with a pick-up time of around 5 am.Staying at least one night in Pemuteran makes the trip less rushed and tends to be more cost-effective. This approach avoids the complications of long-distance travel and potential decompression issues associated with driving at higher altitudes right after diving.\nPemuteran, the nearest village to Menjangan, offers a range of lodging options, from budget homestays to luxurious resorts, making it an ideal base for divers.The charm and tranquillity of Pemuteran haven\u2019t changed over the years, except for a few additional yummy eateries along the main road (I recommendthe Sagefor a tasty and healthy dinner).\nArjuna Homestayis one of the best options for astylish retreat at the best price for scuba divers. Located alongside Dive Concepts, it offers divers double, twin and family rooms with tasteful decor and a long swimming pool in the shade of frangipani trees. Having tested both the ground-floor rooms with direct access to the pool and the first-floor rooms, I preferred the latter since the view from the balcony is incredible. And let\u2019s give a special mention to the delicious breakfast buffet (best crepes I have eaten in Bali) served on their rooftop terrace with incredible views of the mountain backdrop.\nIf you\u2019re looking to splurge on your nature getaway, there is a luxury resort right in the West Bali National Park, theNusa Bay Menjangan. It is not for all budgets, but the experience looks amazing.",

        "title": "Where is the best diving in Bocas del Toro, Panama?",
        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/diving-bocas-del-toro/",
        "content": "I decided to end my three months in Panama by spending a month in theCaribbean Archipelago of Bocas del Toro. It gave me enough time to dive, snorkel, mountain bike, kayak and hike across it, from Boca del Drago to Cayos Zapatilla. Bocas del Toro is home to theBastimentos Marine National Park, Panama\u2019s first marine park, created in 1988 and covering an area of 230 km\u00b2 near the border with Costa Rica. It extends from the island of Bastimentos to the Zapatilla Cays and covers approximately 50% of the archipelago. With one national park, 9 main islands, 50 cays and more than 200 islets, it\u2019s only natural to wonder where to go scuba diving in the archipelago.\nBefore diving in Panama, I often heard people praisingdiving in Coiba(rightfully) and having mixed feelings about diving in Bocas del Toro. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why. I had the opportunity to dive in the Caribbean coast during my stay inPanama City, in Portobello, and I loved what I saw. Besides, one cannot compare the environments of the Pacific Ocean with the Caribbean Sea: these are entirely different ecosystems.\nMy first guess was that people might be more easily impressed by the sharks of Coiba. Macro critters and otherfunny-looking sea creaturesbeloved by marine biology nerds might require more experience to appreciate fully. My second guess came when I started looking at the map more closely: I realised that some people didn\u2019t know there was a marine national park in Bocas del Toro! I studied the national park boundaries and where most dive sites were. So here is my story of trying to understand the geography of Bocas del Toro\u2019s reefs, thelogistics of diving thereand, of course, whether it is worth the trip (spoiler alert: yes!).\nDiving in Bocas del Toroat a glance\nI went scuba diving right at the beginning of my stay in Bocas del Toro since I stayed a couple of nights at thePalma Royale hotelon thesouthernmost tip of Bocas Townbefore moving to anapartment further north. The main dive centres are all in this area so that you can board your diving boat only 5 minutes after breakfast. The journey from Santa Catalina near Coiba National Parl took me more than 12 hours, including a boat arrival on Colon Island by moonlight. I couldn\u2019t dream of a better set-up to start my Bocas del Toro adventure while making things easy to rest a bit.\nMaking a list of the best dive sites in Bocas del Toro isn\u2019t easy. On the one hand, there is this marine playground which is so vast, and on the other hand, the area where most scuba diving boats go is quite limited (between Colon and Solarte Islands), but a few further sites. These are only accessible when the conditions of currents and swell are favourable, typically during the peak season of September/October, and I visited Bocas del Toro in March/April. But so you know, I heard many good things about the two dive sites:Sachen and Tiger Rock.\nFinally,the area between Bastimentos Island and Zapatilla Cays is seldom scuba dived. A few resorts might offer it, but they don\u2019t have scuba diving gear and a compressor: everything comes from Bocas Town, including the dive guides! So to make the logistics cost worthy, it means having enough people to join. I thought we almost had this, but unfortunately, the couple I was supposed to join cancelled.\nHence here are the 5 dive sites I visited from Bocas Town with Bocas Dive Center, scuba diving tank included (keep reading, you\u2019ll understand why I\u2019m saying this). Thanks to their limited depth, these dive sites aresuitable for beginner divers. Besides, I never had any current on any of these dives. Bocas del Toro is great spot to get certified.\nThis is usually the instructors\u2019 and divemasters\u2019 favourite dive site because its atmosphere makes themthink about the movie Avatar(hence the name of the dive site). The dive follows a coral and sponge reef with a gentle slope. It is possible to go deeper, but you won\u2019t find anything other than sand. Among the colourful sponges, I found typical Caribbean marine critters such as spotted drums, spiny lobsters, squirrelfish and grey angelfish.\nThe second part of the dive leads to an unexpected sailboat wreck. TheGodewind sailboatwas sunk near the island of Solarte in 2019 for the greatest pleasure of scuba divers in Bocas del Toro: sailboat wrecks are uncommon. This artificial wreck offers incredible views and photo opportunities with its sail still standing, slowly getting covered in sponges. Stay close to your guide; they might show you too the nurse sharks sleeping inside. With a maximum depth of 18 m, even beginner divers can join.\nA beautiful coral and sponge reef with many butterflyfish and feather worms near Solarte Island, where I found a fewinfamous invasive lionfish. But thankfully, not so many! Bocas del Toro actively hunts them, and even a butcher in town (yes!) is selling the lionfish filets.\nThe highlight of the dive site is the artificial shipwreck (yes, another one!) of a trimaran. TheMystic Wind wreckis covered in sponges and giant oysters. We were looking for rays and sharks, but I was still happy only finding yellow schoolmaster snappers hiding inside the cabin.\nIn 2006, a BAe Jetstream of Air Panama couldn\u2019t stop after landing at Bocas del Toro airport due to heavy rainfall. It overran the strip to crash into bushes. There was no casualty, but the plane was beyond repair. This is how it became this surprisingplane wreck dive siteright in front of Bocas Dive Center pier after a few years of sitting near the airport.\nSo, imagine people doing their DSD and how exciting it must be; even experienced divers like me can enjoy a long dive with endless underwater photo opportunities around the plane wreck and below the pier. Between the butterfly fish, the surgeonfish, the angelfish, including many juvenile individuals, the feather worms, the swirling schools of sardines, the trumpetfish and the arrowhead spider crabs, you won\u2019t get bored. The most surprising species of all? Theupside-down jellyfish! So don\u2019t look down at this 5 m deep dive site; make sure to have time for it.\nMyfavourite of all my dives in Bocas del Torois where I found the reef to be the most interesting in shapes and colours while being full of life. The site is mostly flat at the same depth, with a mix of coral reefs, sponges and sandy bottom. Yellow, purple, red, green, orange: the array of colours from the different sponge species in the shape of barrels, tubes or candelabras was staggering.\nWe found severaltoadfish hiding in their rocky den. I\u2019m glad I could count on the eagle eyes of Bocas Dive Center instructors and their expert knowledge of the reef. They might not be as colourful as their Cozumel cousin (splendid toadfish), but they are still an interesting marine critter you won\u2019t see everywhere. The other remarkable species I spotted included butterfly fish, porcupine pufferfish, barracudas and spotted moray eels.\nFor my final dive with Bocas Dive Center, I had a couple of grey angelfish that decided to stick with me at the beginning. They obviously liked to pose for my pictures. Loro Verde reef had many sponge formations but in different shapes than the other sites. But the most surprising was theimpressive number of star brittlescovering most of them. With a little distance, it looked like the sponges were moving.\nI had the pleasure of spotting another toadfish, butmy favourite moment was my encounter with a squad of squids. Spring is the peak season to see them. It was so funny to see how they were both shy and curious. They gave me long minutes to take pictures and videos. The cherry on top was a beautiful stingray swimming by our group right before we ascended to our safety stop.\nAfter scuba diving south of Colon Island, I took a small bus to its northernmost tip:Boca del Drago. It leaves from the main square (Simon Bolivar Park), and the ride costs only 3,50$. It takes about 50 minutes to arrive at the terminus, the famous restaurant Yanis Nori. They\u2019re a local family business and have been serving the best Panamanian seafood recipes with a Caribbean touch since 1989 (if you are only eating lobster once in Bocas del Toro, this is where to have it for 25$).\nOnce in Boca del Drago, it is a 15-minute walk through the mangrove and along the sea until Playa Estrella. Don\u2019t rush because the trail is beautiful, and you can spot cappuccino monkeys and three-toed sloths if you pay attention. The kind gentleman renting masks and snorkels helped mespot my first three-toed sloth. Indeed, I knew the space on the bus would be extremely limited, so I left most of my clothes and all my dive gear behind in Bocas Town. The rental wasn\u2019t expensive (2$), but I regretted not taking at least my mask and snorkel. The mask kept flooding.\nIf many people flock to Playa Estrella (Star Beach), it\u2019s because it\u2019s the home of acolony of photogenic red cushion starfish. Most tourists book a boat tour from Bocas Town, which stops at Playa Estrella (35-40$), but I wasn\u2019t the only one coming by bus either (the bus was usually packed). Unfortunately, despite some level of awareness that the starfish need to be protected (many signs invite tourists not to touch or move them), the loud music of some of the beach restaurants is pushing the starfish away.\nYou might only be able to see them byfreediving to 2 to 5 m deep. I did this; it took me less than 5 minutes to find the first starfish. I spent about 15 minutes in the water taking a few pictures, and that was about it since there was nothing else than sand beside the starfish. Walking further down the beach in a quitter spot allowed me for a great picture in only 30 cm of water.\nSpecial tip: Sleep at Yanis Nori\u2019s guesthouse for at least one night to be the first on-site in the morning. In my case, I stayed for two nights and was invited by the owner\u2019s daughter on amountain bike ride through the jungletowards the east coast of Colon island. On the way, we spotted cappuccino monkeys, howler monkeys and a tiny green-golden dart frog. I used all my forces that day, but I made a new friend that day!\nThis is where things got a little trickier when I tried to go scuba diving inBastimentos Marine National Park. Unfortunately, all the scuba diving resources, which means tanks, compressors, and divemasters, remain in Bocas Town. It means that the resorts on Bastimentos Island, even those advertising scuba diving,bring people and gear from Bocas Town based on demand. You can also directly go diving from Bocas town with a longer boat ride as a day trip. In both cases, it\u2019s a matter of how many people will request it to make it economically viable. I was close to making it, but the couple I was supposed to dive with cancelled at the last minute.\nThe owners of Tranquilo Bay, the dream eco-resort I stayed at on Bastimentos Island, cheered me up, saying they would book me on activities with great snorkelling/free diving and thatI would likely be surprised. I always wanted to improve my skills at taking underwater pictures with a single breath, so here was my opportunity (by necessity)!\nMy first day trip was to the jewels of the Bastimentos National Park:Cayos Zapatilla. Tranquilo Bay is ideally located just in front of them, so it only takes about 20 minutes to get there from their pier. Zapatilla 1 is fully protected and can\u2019t be visited. Zapatilla 2 is dedicated to ecotourism, with marked trails and wood pathways to explore it without damaging anything. I loved spotting great kiskadee birds, freshwater turtles and basilic lizards in its swamp area.\nExploring Zapatilla 2 reefs was still the best part of my day. For safety reasons, the boat captain came with me. We used a kayak to approach the coral reefs of Zapatilla cay #2 in slightly deeper water. From there, I could snorkel and free dive in a beautiful coral reef with no one around. Breath after breath, I found many treasures under the waves: astingraycame to say hi and took me to a sea fan garden on a sandy bottom, I found a crack where thelobsterparty was, I caught a couple ofFrench angelfishon a love parade, and at the end, anurse sharkcame to say bye (but it was too quick for me to take a picture).\nI was never deeper than 5 m, so it helped to have enough time to take pictures. But to be honest, without weights, even if I was only wearing my UV-protected rashguard and leggings, it wasn\u2019t easy to stay long. I spent about 2 hours in the water and never got bored.Kayaking + Snorkellingin the heart of a Caribbean national park? Approved!\nTranquilo Bay is a lodge on Bastimentos Island for all nature lovers, especially birders. As a diver, I was a little bit of an outsider but felt very welcome by their team of naturalist guides. They taught me everything I know today about bird watching, and I returned the favour by leading a night snorkelling session atTranquilo Bay\u2019s own mangrove reefthat no other guest ever asked for.\nI did a first session by day to get my bearings underwater. The part near the mangrove was shallow, maybe a meter of water, but from the pier, there is a slope goingdown to 10 mquickly. The corals near the mangrove were mainly unknown to me, but I did recognise the fire coral that you do not want to touch by any means.\nMy favourite discovery was thelettuce sea slug(Elysia Crispata), whose intricate ruffles come in many shades: blue, pink, purple and green! I had never seen these before: these mangrove coral reefs are staggering. These nudibranchs were in relatively shallow water and often fed on seagrass. Taking a good shot of them wasn\u2019t always easy as they swung along the current. I was just mesmerised by them, and they were another reason to make me regret not taking my macro lens during my year in Latin America.\nAt night, it was like a crab and squid party. Many arrowhead spider crabs came out, but also a new species to me: thechannel clinging crab, also called the Caribbean king crab. But my favourite moment was when we met once again a squad of squids: by night, with a pitch black background, right below the surface, my pictures look like the squid are swimming below a mirror.\nI summed up below everything you need to know to prepare for your trip to go diving in Bocas del Toro: the best season, water temperatures, dive centre and places to stay.\nAnother tricky point about Bocas del Toro is the best diving season. While Panama\u2019s summer (dry) season is from December to April, thebest diving season in Bocas del Toro is in September-October, Bocas\u2019 mini-dry season. I was diving in Bocas del Toro between March and April, and most days were sunny, but we had one weekend with pouring rain, which created floods all over the archipelago.\nThe water is always warm,around 28\u00b0C, so technically, you can dive all year long. I used my wetsuit initially, but it was useless; I ended up diving with only my rashguard and leggings. What you need to take into account in Bocas are the currents. They tend to calm down in September-October, making some of the best dive sites (Sachen, Tiger Rock) on the northern side of the archipelago only accessible at that time.\nBut not all is lost when diving from February to April; this is also theseason to meet squads of squids. This is a cool encounter I had more than once, and I had never seen so many of them before anywhere else in the world.\nThere are two main routes to Bocas del Toro:air or land+sea. The easiest but not the cheapest is obviously to fly (about 130$). Daily flights from Albrook domestic airport in Panama City link Bocas Town in only 1 hour. As someone who tries to avoid flying whenever there is a good land alternative and enjoys exploring more of the country, I took the road.\nThe cheapest is to take thebus between Panama City (Albrook bus terminal) and l\u2019Almirantevia David, the country\u2019s second-largest city, and through the mountains of Chiriqui (28$). It takes about 10 to 12 hours, and I must warn you about the lack of leg space between seats (and I\u2019m not that tall).\nFrom there, you board aboat to reach Bocas Town on Colon Islandfor 10$, which takes less than 30 minutes. There is also aferry servicetwice a day in each direction for only 1$. Be aware that the boats stop after dark. If you arrive (like me!) after the sun sets, your best chance is to go to the main gas station of Almirante and find a private boat agreeing to take you. I was so relieved I thought it was fair to give the double fare to the lovely family who welcomed me on their boat (instead of paying for a last-minute hotel too)\nThere are also somecomfortable shuttleslinking Bocas del Toro with Boquete (Panama\u2019s coffee capital, a fantastic way to split the journey, 30$ \u2013 boat ride included, it was the best option to stop there on my way back) and Panama City (40$). I also met many people coming from Costa Rica this way (27$ for Puerto Viejo).\nI cannot recommend enoughBocas Dive Center, with its spotless facility and friendly team. The dive centre is on the first floor of theDivers Paradise Hotel, where you\u2019ll also find their restaurant, Pier 19. At the time of my visit, the team of instructors offeredcourses and guided dives in English, Spanish, French, and German.\nTheirlarge boatreminded me of my dives in the US. It was so comfortable, with so much space to gear up and relax at the surface interval. Even if most dive sites are not that far away, I\u2019d go diving anytime in these excellent conditions. Thanks to their dive site by their pier, Mayday, people taking a Discovery dive or doing their Open water training have the best conditions to learn.\nDuring the month I stayed in Bocas del Toro, I also had the opportunity to join theirmonthly dive against the debris. It\u2019s every first Sunday of the month. The dive is free (donations welcome for PADI Aware Foundation) and is the opportunity for a meet-up between local divers and visitors. I loved it, but I soon discovered scuba diving in shallow water with an always heavier trash mesh bag is not as easy as it looked.\nI stayed in 5 different places in one month in Bocas del Toro, including aone-bedroom flatto work from for three weeks. Here are the two best hotels I used at the beginning and the end of my stay.\nRight across the streets from Bocas Dive Center, thePalma Royale hotelis located on thesouth tip of Bocas Town, where it\u2019s mostly quiet at night while being close enough to the lively streets. The hotel offers rooms, suites and apartments with a kitchen. I stayed in a suite with a separate bedroom beside the main room.\nI loved thecoffee cornernext to the sofa, where I could make a fresh brew when waking up or working. The small fridge was convenient for storing the delicious salads from the Super Gourmet Deli right next to the hotel. My balcony overlooked the water, and I could see the ferries coming in the morning.\nGuests who book breakfast with the hotel have to walk 2 minutes to the Buena Vista restaurant, which belongs to the same owner. With a voucher system, you get a deliciouschoice of cooked breakfastserved to your table.\nI will go straight to the point: I absolutely fell in love with theTranquilo Bay eco-lodge. Beyond designingthe most eco-friendly lodgethey could, the American family behind the project also set up a fantastic concept. Every guest is on full board from breakfast to dinner, including drinks AND day activities. Breakfast and dinner were at the main building, and there was a small trail through the jungle to reach it.

        "content": "Is it even possible to godiving in Baliand not dream ofswimming with manta rays and mola-molas? What many divers don\u2019t realise is that to fulfil this dream, they need to hop over to a different island. While part of Bali\u2019s province, Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan are two neighbouring islands off its southeast coast, offering not only some of the most thrilling dives in the region but also stunning landscapes, from golden beaches to dramatic cliffs. But the question you\u2019ll quickly ask will is it better to godiving in Nusa Penidaor Nusa Lembongan, as like most people you won\u2019t probably have the time to do both.\nEach island has its advantages depending on what you\u2019re looking for\u2014whether it\u2019s accessibility, marine life diversity, or a mix of diving and sightseeing. After a short trip to Nusa Lembongan in 2015, where I saw my first-ever mola-mola, I was eager to return and explore both islands in depth. So last summer, I packed my gear andspent a week diving in Nusa Penida in August, followed by another week in Nusa Lembongan in September\u2014right in the heart of mola-mola season and peak tourism. This guide breaks down my experiences to help you decide which island is the best fit for your diving adventure.\nDiving inNusa Penidaat a glance\nDiving inNusa Lembonganat a glance\nNusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan offer some ofBali\u2019s best dive sites, from drift dives to manta ray cleaning stations and seasonal encounters with the elusive mola-mola. Both islands are part of theNusa Penida Marine Protected Area (MPA), a 200 km\u00b2 zone intended to balance tourism and conservation since 2010.\nThe MPA is divided into marine tourism, sustainable fisheries, seaweed farming, and sacred and core zones. Fishing is prohibited in core and tourism zones, though small-scale fishing often continues due to weak enforcement. In 2024, Nusa Penida\u2019s ecological importance received international recognition with its designation as both aMission Blue Hope Spotand aParticularly Sensitive Sea Area(PSSA) by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).\nWhen I first visited Nusa Lembongan,I didn\u2019t realise that most dive trips actually go toNusa Penida, especially its southern coast. Back in 2015, tourism was slowly emerging in Nusa Penida. It wasn\u2019t yet a thing to be based there to go diving, but that changed when an Instagram photo of Kelingking Beachwent viral, making it today,Bali\u2019s most popular day trip. While Crystal Bay and Manta Point are among the most popular dive sites in Bali, on my latest trip, Crystal Bay didn\u2019t live up to its fame, and Manta Point had some frustrating moments.\nHowever, one of the best parts of my trip wasdiving for the first time on thenorth side of both Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan. The coral reefs there are incredibly healthy, with fewer divers and plenty of marine life\u2014includingmola-molas. It\u2019s a great alternative to the overcrowded southern sites and a reminder that these islands still have some quieter spots worth exploring. You\u2019ll find below a breakdown of the best dive sites based on my personal experience.\nManta Point is certainlyNusa Penida\u2019s most famous dive site, offering near-guaranteed manta ray encounters year-round at a cleaning station. Seeing manta rays glide gracefully through the waters is a magical experience that no one can ever forget. The site has a resident manta population, but conditions at the surface can be challenging from December to March. The rainy season often brings rough seas, leading to frequent cancellations. When the sea is calm, the shallow cleaning station (5\u201310m) makes it accessible to Open Water divers like snorkelers .\nIt\u2019s important todistinguish Manta Point from Manta Bay. Manta Point is further but better for manta sightings. My dives were always lucky to this regard, though not in the numbers I experienced in 2015 when I saw a \u201cmanta highway\u201d that even my guides called rare. Check \u201cEverything you need to know about swimming with manta rays\u201d below, for more insights about the current diving experience in Manta Point.\nThe second half of the dive usually heads toward a deeper rocky point (20\u201324m), apotential mola-mola spotin the season (July-October). The marine life encounters I had there included an octopus, a bamboo shark, a huge number of blue-spotted stingrays in trove, and schools of yellow-lined snappers. On my last dive, most groups on my boat saw one mola-mola there, but I was unluckily paired with an air hog, costing us this magical sighting. At least, I was delighted for that Indonesian diver who had come so many times to Nusa Penida and was finally awarded this memory of a lifetime.\nMy dive parameters\nCrystal Bay is the 2ndmost popular dive site in Nusa Penida,famous for its seasonal mola-mola sightingsbetween July and October. Divers venture to depths of 30\u201340m, hoping to spot the elusive oceanic sunfish as they rise from the deep for getting cleaned-up by wrasse. The bay is stunning, with white sand and coral gardens on each side, in addition to excellent visibility with clear blue waters \u2014sometimes up to 40m.\nHowever, the further you swim away from the beach, the stronger and more unpredictable, down and up currentsget. This dive is suitable only for experienced divers if the goal is to look for mola-molas. The shallower areas provide a more sheltered environment, often used for training dives, with a sandy slope and reefs full of butterflyfish, bannerfish, and angelfish around it. Be aware that mola-molas like colder waters, so water temperatures in Crystal Bay often drop to 23\u00b0C; I even had a 19\u00b0C thermocline on one of my dives from 15m deep. A 5mm full wetsuit with a hood and booties is a suitable choice to dive here.\nDespite 4 dives at Crystal Bay,I didn\u2019t spot a single mola-mola this time. My first visit in 2015 brought beginner\u2019s luck with a sighting on my first dive, but since then, my attempts have been unsuccessful. Instead, I saw a hawksbill turtle, barracudas, a sea snake, and a crested nembrotha nudibranch. The conditions were intense, with strong currents pulling in all directions. I sometimes had to grip a rock for several minutes to stay in place. Despite spotting many nudibranchs, underwater macro photography here is a challenge, as holding steady in the current is nearly impossible.\nMy dive parameters\nThe north coast of Nusa Penida features a long stretch of coral slopes teeming with marine life and offering thebest drift diving in Bali.. The currents are sustained but manageable, though diving at slack tide may require a few fin kicks. The coral gardens here are among the healthiest I\u2019ve seen, bursting with vibrant hard and soft corals in a dazzling array of colours. I couldn\u2019t believe I had overlooked this area for so long\u2014each dive at Sental, Ped, and PMG felt like a hidden gem, far less crowded than the island\u2019s southern sites.\nTurtles, frogfish, and large schools of fusiliers and anthias are common sightings, along with pyramid butterflyfish, raccoon butterflyfish, bigeyes, clownfish, Clark\u2019s anemonefish, and Koran angelfish. The peacefulness of these sites only makes the experience more special. While everyone flocks to Manta Point and Crystal Bay, our group rarely crossed paths with others, a rarity in Bali. And after countless unsuccessful attempts at Crystal Bay,I finally had my second-ever mola-mola sighting at PMG\u2014just five minutes into the dive, between 30 and 35 meters. It was a fleeting moment, just enough time for a quick video, but it left me in awe.\nDespite the excitement of the mola-mola,my favourite site was Sental. The explosion of marine life\u2014huge red gorgonians, bouquets of yellow and pink soft corals, massive barrel sponges, coral roses, and tubular sponges\u2014made it unforgettable. A nonchalant green turtle and an energetic hawksbill turtle drifted past while two massive frogfish, one yellow and one black, hid inside a crevice of the reef. This part of Nusa Penida is truly underrated, offering some of the most pristine dive sites in Bali.\nMy dive parameters\nKarang Sari is ahidden gem on Nusa Penida\u2019s east coast. With a steep sloping reef, almost a wall, it provides plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. Despite diving in August\u2014the busiest month in Penida\u2014our buddy team had the site entirely to ourselves. It\u2019s even quieter than the north coast, as only dive centres based on that side tend to venture this far.\nBeyond its colourful corals, Karang Sari also holds thepotential for pelagic encounters, including eagle rays and the elusive mola-mola. However, luck wasn\u2019t on our side that day. Instead, we enjoyed seeing thriving hard corals, giant barrel sponges, and colourful sea anemones. Before ascending to our safety stopI came across acoral restoration project. The artificial structures were covered in flourishing coral growth, a promising sign of conservation efforts in the area.\nMy dive parameters\nThe north coast of Nusa Lembongan offers afast-paced drift diveover a coral meadow teeming with life.. The current here is strong and steady, making it fun for divers who want to \u201cfly\u201d like a manta ray. A reef hook can be useful for those who want to take a break and observe marine life up close. This site is best suited for intermediate divers due to the speed of the drift. This dive site is more suited to video than photography for the same reason.\nAt the end of the Mangrove drift dive, the famousBlue Cornerawaits\u2014reserved forexperienced divers only. This dramatic drop-off plunges to 40 meters, offering the chance to see rays, tunas, sharks, and even mola-molas during the season. However, the combination of depth and unpredictable currents means that only highly skilled divers can take on this challenge. In practice, few dive centres venture there, as it\u2019s rare to have a boat filled exclusively with advanced divers. Indeed, I haven\u2019t had the chance to dive Blue Corner yet, but it remains on my list for a future adventure.\nMy dive parameters\nManta rays can be seen in Nusa Penida year-round. Still, the rainy season (December to March) often brings rough seas, making conditions unsafe at the surface. Strong swells can prevent divers from returning to the boat safely, and many operators frequently redirect trips to more sheltered sites. If encountering mantas is a priority for your trip, it\u2019s best toplan accordingly to avoid disappointment.\nWith Nusa Penida\u2019s growing popularity, manta encounters aren\u2019t always as magical as they once were. Manta Point, in particular, has becomeoverwhelmingly crowded, making it harder to admire manta rays without distractions. In some cases, tensions have even escalated between guides and underwater photographers.\nThe Nusa Penida Marine Protected Area (MPA) has established codes of conduct for divers and snorkelers tominimise disturbance to the mola-mola (sunfish) and the manta rays. Initially developed by theCoral Triangle Center(CTC) between 2010\u20132012, the guidelines were updated in 2021 but remain largely voluntary.\nCurrent recommendations include maintaining a5-meter distancefrom marine megafauna, avoiding loud noises and sudden movements, and discouraging flash photography. Touching marine life or coral is obviously out of question. While scuba divers generally respect these rules, pressure from large numbers of snorkelers\u2014especially those freediving and attempting close contact\u2014remains the most serious issue, according to CTC.\nSince 2018, management of the MPA has shifted to the Bali Province\u2019s Department of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, with CTC continuing to offer technical support and guidance. Enforcement, however, remains limited. Monthly patrols are still carried out in collaboration with the police and the navy, but CTC recognises that budget constraints and a lack of rapid response capacity hinder effective monitoring. A recent partnership with Mission Blue has helped fund up to3 patrols per month.\nWhile tourism has surged\u2014from 200,000 visitors per year in 2015 to a current low estimate of 6 million\u2014revenue generation has also increased. A daily retribution ticket for diving and snorkelling was introduced in 2023 (100,000 IDR \u2013 included in the tours and activities price). However, the funds collected still fall short of what\u2019s needed to manage the MPA sustainably and regulate tourism, according to CTC.Site overcrowding is a growing concern, especially at Crystal Bay and Manta Point. While some carrying capacity data has been shared with the provincial government, regulations have yet to be voted.\nOn my August trip, knowing it was the peak tourist season, I took a 7 am snorkelling tour, which provided the most rewarding experience\u2014manta rays everywhere. Our group was alone in the water for the most part. On my September trip, I came back to scuba dive there, hoping for smaller crowds. Butby 9 am, the situation at Manta Point becomes unbearableas waves of snorkelling and diving boats descend on the site (I counted 35 to 40 boats each time, I let you do the maths with 10 people on board on average). The sheer number of people in the water makes encounters chaotic, with mantas often forced to navigate through clusters of divers rather than gliding undisturbed in their natural habitat.\nI was, indeed, one of these many divers contributing to the pressure on the site. But the issue isn\u2019t about singling out individuals\u2014it\u2019s about theurgent need to cap the number of visitors and license operators. The current situation is unsustainable, and while limiting access may increase costs, it\u2019s now a necessary step. Without adequate regulation, the experience will continue to deteriorate for marine life and visitors, pushing away the golden goose that supports the local economy.\nBefore diving in Nusa Penida and Lembongan, I specifically asked the two dive centres I dived with about strobe usage, expecting clear guidelines since this is an MPA. Both told me the same thing, that there was no official ban against using strobes with manta rays but acknowledged thatwe must refrain from using flashes when photographing mola molas. CTC confirmed that the no-flash guideline was originally a precautionary rule based on the mola\u2019s deepwater habitat and not necessarily based onscientific studies. Still, it seems there is a miscommunication regarding the manta ray guidelines.\nI personally experienced anaggressive encounter with a snorkelling guidewho took it upon himself to act as the \u201cstrobe police,\u201d firmly shaking my shoulder and insulting me underwater. I also heard from two other underwater photographers who\u2019d experienced similar incidents. While I fully supportresponsible strobe use, rules must be clearly communicated, and enforced consistently.\nMy recommendation? Stay overnight on Nusa Penida and book aprivate early-morning snorkelling session\u2014before the dive boats arrive. You\u2019ll have a much better chance of enjoying a peaceful, natural interaction. There isno need for strobes below the surface, just the morning light.\nMola-molas are one of the main reasons divers flock to Nusa Penida. Unlike manta rays, which can be seen year-round,spotting these elusive sunfish requires patience and luck, even in peak season. While Crystal Bay and Blue Corner are the most famous sites for sightings, they are not the only ones\u2014a crucial point to keep in mind when planning your diving holiday in Bali.\nThe mola-molas typically emerge when the waters are colderbetween July and October. While July to September was traditionally considered the prime season, recent observations from divers and underwater photographers suggest a shift. August to October now offers the best chances\u2014particularly in September, which seems to be the peak month for sightings.\nSpotting a mola-mola in Nusa Penida requires patience, luck, and the right diving conditions. These deepwater giants typically appear around 30m, making anAdvanced Open Water certification essential. They thrive in colder waters, preferring temperatures around 23\u00b0C. Due to thermoclines, temperatures can sometimes drop as low as 19\u00b0C, so proper thermal protection is crucial. Personally, I used a 3/4mm full wetsuit with a 2mm sleeveless top with an integrated hood, gloves, and booties, which have kept me warm enough even in the chilliest dives.\nUnlike manta rays, which are easy to find, spotting a mola-mola is more like searching for the Holy Grail. Even in September, which is considered the most reliable month,scuba divers can go on multiple dives in Crystal Bay without success, while others get lucky on their first attempt. I got beginner luck this way in 2015, but in 2024 I\u2019ve dived 4 times in Crystal Bay before finally spotting one mola-mola off Nusa Penida\u2019s north coast!\u00a0However, Crystal Bay now suffers from the same overcrowding than Manta Point. Given the constant noise of boat engines, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that the mola-molas decided to go hanging somewhere else.\nDiving in Crystal Bay requires experience.The currents can be intense, ranging from strong drifts to unpredictable upcurrents and downcurrents. If you have fewer than 50 dives, I highly recommend gaining more experience before attempting these sites. Additionally, good air consumption is essential\u2014some divers who think they are experienced enough underestimate how quickly they\u2019ll burn through their tanks at depth while battling currents, which can lead to shortened dives and frustration for the group.\nLastly,divers behaviour plays a crucial role in successful sightings. Mola-molas are shy, and reckless movements can scare them away. The best approach is to position yourself strategically on their side (never in front or below), stay still, and let them come near you.\nNusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan offer farmore than just world-class diving. From breathtaking landscapes to unique cultural experiences, both islands have plenty to explore beyond the underwater realm.\nNusa Penida\u2019s dramatic landscapes are among the most stunning in Indonesia, but the island\u2019s growing popularity means most sights get crowded, especially withday-trippers arriving around 10 am and leaving by 3.30 am. To make the most of your visit, timing is everything. The east coast, including Diamond Beach, is best explored at sunrise before 8 am, while southwest highlights like Kelingking Beach are most enjoyable after 4 PM when the crowds start to thin.\nTravelling across the island can take longer than expected, as there\u2019s no direct road connecting the southern viewpoints\u2014you\u2019ll need to drive back and forth, witheach trip taking 45 to 60 minutes. Renting a scooter (international driving license required) offers flexibility and significant savings, as taxis can be expensive (around 200K IDR for a 10 km ride).\nNusa Lembongan iscompact and easy to explore. Unlike Nusa Penida, distances are shorter, and you can comfortably tour the island in a single day. Renting a scooter (international driving license required) is the best way to get around, as taxi pick-up trucks can be pricey (e.g., 100K IDR for a 4 km ride from Jungut Batu Beach to the Yellow Bridge\u2014comparable to private car rates in Nusa Penida).\nPlanning your dive trip to Nusa Penida or Nusa Lembongan requires some preparation tomake the most of your experience. Here\u2019s what you need to know regarding the best time to go, the best dive centres, the best places to stay and how to get to each island.\nThe best time to dive in Nusa Penida isbetween May and October, during the dry season when conditions at sea are generally calmer. Water temperatures range from 26 to 28\u00b0C in the north and 22 to 24\u00b0C in the south, with visibility typically 20 to 30 meters. For those hoping to spot mola-mola (ocean sunfish), the season runs from July to October, when colder upwellings bring them closer to recreational diving depths. However, this also means lower water temperatures \u2014 a thermocline dropped the temperature to 19\u00b0C at Crystal Bay in September during one of my dives \u2014so a 5mm wetsuit is recommended.\nUnlike Bali\u2019s mainland dive spots like Amed, Tulamben, and Padang Bai, where diving is possible year-round, Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan can bechallenging during the rainy season(December to April). Stronger swells often make sites like Manta Point and Crystal Bay too dangerous, with some dive operators even taking divers there just to demonstrate the rough conditions before moving to the more sheltered north coast, where visibility remains decent but slightly reduced.\nLook for dive shops with small group ratios, experienced guides, and a strong focus on safety. Two excellent options are Purple Dive in Nusa Penida and Dive Concepts in Nusa Lembongan.\nIn Nusa Penida, I loved my tranquil dives withPurple Dive. They have a gorgeous dive centre on the north coast in Ped, with an infinity pool overlooking Mount Agung on the other side of the sea. This is where you meet up in the morning to prepare your dive gear before boarding their pickup truck to the boat mooring a little further down the road. Their location on the north coast offers better access to the east coast dive sites, which are often too far for other dive centres\u2014especially those based in Lembongan. This is the best option if you want to dive away from the crowds. They are aPADI 5-Star IDC Centre, providing all PADI courses, from Open Water to Instructor-level training. After diving, guests return to enjoy a vegetarian lunch and can relax by the pool for the rest of the afternoon.\nIn Nusa Lembongan, I had the most fun diving withDive Concepts. They offer the best dive deals on the islands while maintaining a professional but friendly experience. Their Indonesian divemasters take spotting seriously, ensuring you\u2019ll create unforgettable underwater memories. As anSSI dive centre, they provide all SSI courses up to professional levels. They also offer free Nitrox for certified divers. However, the oxygen concentration is limited to 28-30% due to the depths of local dive sites. I first dived with them in 2015 and was happy to see them still thriving\u2014they\u2019ve expanded and now operate four boats, allowing them to run several daily trips to Crystal Bay and Manta Point. The excursion to Nusa Penida and Lembongan\u2019s north coast is typically a three-tank trip, finishing with a power drift dive at Mangrove. Please note that their way of operating means you won\u2019t go much to more confidential dive sites, especially during the mola-mola season. They provide plenty of snacks and coffee/tea but don\u2019t expect a full meal.\nTransportation in Bali can be tricky, but crossing the sea to Nusa Penida or Nusa Lembongan means avoiding the notorious road traffic. First,you\u2019ll need to reach one of the three harbourswhere boats leave for Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan:\nSanur Harbour(Best for most travellers): It offers the most flexible options with departures from 6:30 am to 5:00 pm. It\u2019s a 40-minute drive from the airport (longer during peak traffic hours: 8\u201310 am and 4\u20136 pm). It typically takes 30 minutes to reach Nusa Lembongan and 45 minutes to Nusa Penida. You canpre-book your boat ticket here.\nKusamba Harbour(Best if you\u2019re in Ubud or Sidemen): It\u2019s the closest harbour to Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan. Crossing to Nusa Penida takes about 20 minutes, and only 15 minutes to reach Jungut Batu Beach on Nusa Lembongan. This harbour is quieter than Sanur, making it a great option to avoid crowds. You canpre-book your boat ticket here.\nPadang Bai Harbour(Best if you\u2019re in Amed): \u00a0Located about 1h15 from the south of Bali, Padang Bai is the closest harbour to Amed for those coming from the northeast. There is one fast ferry per day at 4:00 pm to both Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida. You canpre-book your boat ticket here.\nYou can also take theslow ferryfrom Padang Bai to Nusa Penida. It takes about 2 hours. It is a great budget-friendly option for those looking to explore Nusa Penida independently, especially if you\u2019ve already rented a scooter in Bali. The cost is around \u20ac5 each way. The slow ferry departs daily at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm (only the 10:00 am ferry runs on Sundays). No online booking is available, so you can show up around 8:30 am at Padang Bai and buy your ticket at the \u201cOnline Tiket\u201d booth. Note there is no slow ferry to Nusa Lembongan.\nNusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan now offer a wide range of accommodation options, from budget to luxury. On this trip, I booked my accomodation last minute and still found some lovely family-run guesthouses. However if you are looking to splurge on something nicer, make sure to book in advance.\nOn my previous trip, I stayed atPondok Baruna, which is conveniently located right next to Dive Concepts. Unfortunately, this time they were fully booked since they only have a few rooms, so it\u2019s best to book in advance. So I stayed at Arya Inn, a charming family guesthouse located a bit off the main road of Jungut Batu, with a big garden and a swimming-pool. The location was perfect, just a 5-minute walk to Dive Concepts and right next to the best and most affordable Indonesian eatery on the island (Warung Bu Candra). Unfortunately, they seem to not be available anymore. In the same area, you can have a look atRadya Homestayfor an affordable stay with a pool and a walking distance to the beach.\nFor those looking for higher-end options near Jungut Batu Beach, I recommend theIndiana Kenanga Resort.If you\u2019re seeking a quieter, more natural setting, head across the yellow bridge to Nusa Ceningan and stay at theSegara Seaside Resort.\nThanks to having a scooter from Amed, I was able to venture a bit further from the dive center in Nusa Penida. This flexibility led me to findExotic View Cottagein the village of Batu Nunggul, offering a quiet, peaceful setting with a lovely sunset view, the sounds of children from the nearby school, and a nearby night market for dinner. It was also strategically located to be one of the first to visit Diamond Beach in the early morning.\nOther more comfortable options in Nusa Penida include theSebali Penida Beach Resort(luxury) and theSunrise Cottage(mid-range). Both are located from a walking distance to Purple Dive centre.",

        "content": "Since 2012, I have seen the tiny village of Tulamben, on Bali\u2019s northeastern coast, evolving from a sleepy fishing community into one of the most popular diving destinations worldwide. The area now features a stretch of dive resorts, from budget-friendly to luxury options, reaching as far as Kubu further north. Best known for the iconic USAT Liberty shipwreck,Tulamben divingoffers a variety of underwater experiences for all skill levels but is, above all, aparadise for macro underwater photographers. It\u2019s not rare to meet famous underwater photographers or stumble upon a photo competition on its pebble beaches. Indeed, the ease of shore diving combined with the rare species spotted in Tulamben\u2019s waters explains the success. Whendiving in Bali, a trip to its northeast coast is a must for any passionate scuba diver, free diver or snorkeler.\nAs I\u2019m taking slow travel a step further, I decided to make Amed, 20 minutes away, my regional base while exploring Indonesia and neighbouring Southeast Asian countries. Over a year, it gave me the opportunity to dive each site multiple times in different conditions, revealing the characteristics of each location. After50 logged dives from Batu Belah to Kubu, over a year, here are my 5 favourite dive sites. While number 1 is obvious, number 2 is my absolute favourite macro dive site in Tulamben.\nDiving inTulambenat a glance\nThe USAT Liberty shipwreck is undoubtedlyTulamben\u2019s most iconic dive siteand a must-visit for any diver in Bali. This World War II cargo ship, torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in 1942, ended on the beach but was later pushed into the sea by the eruption of Mount Agung in 1963. Resting between 5 and 30 meters deep, just a short swim from the shore, it is one of the most accessible wreck dives in the world, suitable for divers of all levels.\nDiving the USAT Liberty offers a fascinating combination of history and marine life. The wreck is covered in corals and sponges, now home to a diverse array of marine species. Trevallies, sweetlips, barracudas, and batfish are frequent visitors, whilesea turtles occasionally say hi. Macro enthusiasts will find a wealth of smaller creatures like nudibranchs and ornate ghost pipefish tucked away in the corals.\nHere is the list of the most notorious species I found at the Liberty shipwreck:\nDiving the Libertyat sunrise or in the afternoon is best to truly appreciate this site and avoid the busiest times. Early morning dives are especially enchanting, with the calm waters and soft lighting creating a serene atmosphere. Learn more about diving at theUSAT Liberty shipwreckin my dedicated article.\nMy dive log at the Liberty Shipwreck:\nLocated south of Tulamben, Batu Niti boasts volcanic sandy slopes with abundant macro life and many more surprises. Besides being a beautiful beach in a natural setting where cute dogs and baby goats roam, it features thebest diversity of critters I could find in Tulamben: nudibranchs, baby frogfish, ghost pipefish, harlequin shrimps and my very first wonderpus octopus. One of the extra reasons that makes me love Batu Niti is the extra friendly team taking care of the divers. While simple, they built some practical and clean installations for scuba divers.\nHere is the list of the most notorious species I found in Batu Niti:\nAnd this is the list of nudibranch species I saw, starting with a big group from the hypselodoris family:\nThe following were the most difficult to spot, either because of their size, some being in their juvenile form or being almost transparent like the last one:\nThese were among the largest species of nudibranchs I saw; the only reason to miss them is because sometimes we have the mask too close to the sand to spot the tiniest ones, so don\u2019t forget to take some distances once in a while:\nThe best route consists ofwalking to the end of the beach near the temple on the right side and entering the water in front of the buoy. Around the cement block anchoring the buoy, between 18 and 22m, this is where I found the most interesting marine species. Going deeper in Batu Niti has never paid. As your non-decompression time runs out, you swim back to the beginning of the beach in the shallows, where among the rocks and the diamond sea urchins, there are still some excellent surprises to be found. So navigation is pretty straightforward, which is not the case everywhere.\nMy dive log in Batu Niti:\nLocated north of Tulamben, Batu Ringgit dive site belongs to the village of Kubu, which has become thelatest macro hotspot among passionate underwater photographers(see also Gerombong below). Its topography with volcanic sandy slopes is very similar to Batu Niti\u2019s. Still, the difference here is thatit is worth diving deeper, to about 28-30 m. While the diversity of species I met was slightly lower than the other dive sites of my top 5, there is one nudibranch, mostly only found there, that I fell in love with: theIriomote Phyllodesmium\u2013 I had the pleasure to see three of them!\nThere are two main patches of white hydroids around 28 m deep, and this is among them we look for this elegant white nudibranch. The first time, I was shocked by its size: it\u2019s big; all the individuals I saw were about 10 cm. But if you\u2019re lucky enough to have them lounging with their gracious cerata forming like a white dahlia, you\u2019re in for a great shot. But don\u2019t overjoy too quickly, theslight current I had each timemade taking the perfect shot way more challenging than I thought for a nudibranch of this size (no need for a macro lens). And the cherry on top? If you also get an emperor shrimp riding it. Talking about emperor shrimps, I saw another one riding a mexichromis on the same dive.\nHere is the list of the most notorious species I found in Batu Ringgit:\nAnd this is the list of nudibranch species I saw:\nNavigation-wise, it is simple and hard at the same time. If you are going for a casual dive, you do a loop from the entry point in front of the entry point. But things get a bit trickier when you start looking for specific species, such as the Phyllodesmium, because everything looks more or less the same. So, the only way to do this is to have a clear direction at the descent andnavigate with the depth gauge in sight. Another point where I have mixed feelings is that the preparation area for the divers is relatively ok at the parking level. But as you go down to the beach among the tall coconut trees, you notice the amount of trash everywhere, and on the way back, I don\u2019t recommend the shower and toilet.\nMy dive log in Batu Ringgit:\nGerombong is all about discovering the tiniest, the most bizarre, but beautiful macro critters. Located the furthest in the north of Tulamben, it is certainly the most popular muck/macro dive site at the moment. And for this exact reason, Gerombong is not making it to the top of my list. Despite ajaw-dropping diversity of nudibranch species(the highest of all the dive sites), a sandy slope but also a beautiful reef, wall and cavern on each side,you\u2019d better keep away from it in high season.\nThis is the one site where I got the most nervous because of large groups of inexperienced divers who have no idea what buoyancy or frog kicking above the seabed means. If you happen to be near one of their guides and he finds something cool, you\u2019ll find yourself engulfed in a cloud in a matter of seconds. So you\u2019ve been warned: Gerombong is a fantastic dive site, but avoid the months of February, May, and then June to September (if you do the maths, it\u2019s indeed half of the year).\nHere is the list of the most notorious species I found in Gerombong:\nNavigation-wise, Gerombong is a super easy dive site. The pebble beach near the temple, giving the name to the spot, is not that long. The main entry point is on the right side. Watch out for these big pebbles (don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help) becausethe slope from the parking to the water is steep, besides having them rolling below your feet. At 5 m deep, you directly find a sandy slope with a reef and a wall on your left. And on your right, between 18 and 22 m deep, you have the muck slope where you can find everything and anything (I\u2019ve even witnessed one case of nudibranch cannibalism!).\nSimilarly to Batu Niti, it doesn\u2019t pay to go deep in Gerombong. However, even staying an hour at 20 m to take sharp pictures of the tiniest nudibranchs can make you drop your non-decompression time faster than you imagine.If you\u2019re a passionate underwater photographer, get Nitrox. In Gerombong, every dive is a surprise. The reef and the wall at the entry on the left were also fantastic, with golden spadefish (batfish family), giant cuttlefish and sea anemones.\nMy dive log in Gerombong:\nPerfect for both beginners and macro enthusiasts, Melasti isone of the classic muck dive sites of Tulamben. But classic doesn\u2019t mean overrated; it is quite the opposite! It was always full of good surprises, and I never felt overwhelmed by the number of divers, although it is very popular. The installations for divers are reasonably good, with benches, tables, showers and rinsing tanks (we\u2019ll pass on the unique toilet, though). The area seems to be cleaned compared to many others in Tulamben.\nThe dive site covers wide sandy slopes, which progressively go deep with hardly any coral. To be honest,it takes an excellent dive guide to reach the most common species seen in Melasti: the Costasiella and Stiliger nudibranchs. You must first get the rope between cement blocks around 16 m deep. Take a sharp left turn, and between 14 and 18 m, you should see a field of fan green seaweed, the favourite food of the green sheep nudibranch.\nBut beyond the costasiella and stiliger, which are present all year round, Melasti is often where some of thecoolest critters beloved by scuba diversare found: doto nudibranchs, Pikachu nudibranchs and baby frogfish, just to name these. However, about a year ago, everyone stopped to see the yellow rhinopia that stuck around for 3 weeks between November and December.\nHere is the list of the most notorious species I found in Melasti:\nAs you can see, the list isn\u2019t as long as for the other dive sites, but the diversity is staggering.\nMy dive log in Melasti:\nWhile the top five sites are highlights, Tulamben boasts a range of other incredible dive locations:\nThese are other sites I explored, but my experiences ranged from mixed-feeling to total disappointment:\nI summed up below everything you need to know to prepare for your trip to go diving in Tulamben: best season, water temperatures, best dive centre and the best places to stay.\nThe best time to dive in Tulamben isfrom May to October, which is the dry season with water temperatures between 26 and 28\u00b0C and visilibility between 20 and 30 m. However, you can dive in Tulamben all year round; you will have slightly lower visibility conditions than for the rest of the year.  I recommend using a 3mm wetsuit with booties and adjustable fins.\nRegarding the rainy season, now I have been through it 3 times, including my very first trip to Bali, I had a mix of conditions. Most of the time, it\u2019s sunny in the morning, which is usually when we go diving, andit rains for a couple of hours in the afternoonand again at night. This is also when the water is at its warmest between 28 and 30\u00b0C. However, I\u2019m currently going a strong rainy season with full days of rain due to the climatic phenomenon of La Ni\u00f1a.\nTulamben is a shore diving spot, soyou can easily scuba dive from sunrise to sunset. It\u2019s an excellent place for scuba diving addicts looking to dive as much as possible. You are only a short drive away from any dive site in the area going from Kubu to Lipah.\nDive Conceptsoffers training and guided dives at the best price, including free pick-up in the Tulamben & Amed area and free Nitrox for certified divers. Their little caf\u00e9 in the shade of their pergola and frangipani trees is a great chill spot to unwind with watermelon juice at the surface interval or while your dive gear is dip drying.Their dive centre is only a 2-minute drive from the USAT Liberty shipwreck; they are one of the closest dive centres to the shipwreck. Their Indonesian divemasters are incredibly skilled, but my recommendation to my fellow underwater photographers is to ask for Gita or Yoko, and you won\u2019t be disappointed!\nTheMatahari Dive Resortis aninstitution run by a local family since 1991. They were among the first to open on Tulamben beach. Located right between the USAT Liberty and the drop-off dive sites, it\u2019s a great money-saving option for those travelling on a budget. Their standard room is small and basic but clean and cute with their small terrasse. They now have more modern and comfortable Deluxe rooms; however, these are the closest to the street, so try to request #18 or #19 if you want more tranquillity.\nThe resort has relatively narrow ground; the rooms, pool, restaurant, and dive centre are a bit on top of each other, butit feels cute and homey. It has been maintained well over the years, as I recently rechecked it. My favourite point remains their small spa, where you can hear the sound of the waves during your Balinese massage.\nNight starts at 350,000 IDR (about 20\u20ac)\nHere are two ocean-front optionsfor those looking to splurge for their diving holidays in Bali. I didn\u2019t stay since I currently have a house in Amed, but after shortlisting the best resorts on Google Maps, I visited and asked to see the rooms unannounced.\nI found that theMimpi Dive Resorthas it all: the location near the Drop-off dive site on the beach, The overly friendly staff and theelegant Balinese-style cottages. Among beautifully manicured gardens, they have 4 stunning seafront private villas. But even the garden cottages didn\u2019t fail to impress me with theirinner garden and outdoor shower. You can choose between a double room or a twin room where 2 other beds can be fitted (including one on top of the mezzanine). This last option is great for groups of friends who can split the cost and enjoy a diving holiday in style for less.\nNight starts at 1,200,000 IDR (about 68\u20ac)\nThere is no denying that theRelax Bali Dive Resorthas by far themost beautiful swimming pool in the area, and its rooms are the most spacious. However, I found the resort tooisolated in Kubu(especially for those not driving). But if absolute tranquillity in a modern resort is what you are looking for, you\u2019ll be in for a treat. They have independent deluxe bungalows and superior rooms at their sister location, Monkey Bungalow, across the street. All rooms are facing the ocean.\nNight starts at 1,710,000 IDR (about 97\u20ac)\nNote that the high season in Tulamben is July- August, and the period over the Christmas holidays is when prices are higher.",

        "content": "I kept my promise. It took me 7 years, but I promised to return to Gozo and stay much longer. The last time, I thought it was fine to be halfway to everything on Malta\u2019s main island. It included the Cirkewwa ferry terminal for day trips to Gozo. While possible, the two times I did it, it was both exhausting and frustrating. Why? Because it might beMalta\u2019s best secretregarding food, wine, nature and, of course, diving. In a nutshell, Gozo has more flavours and adventures on offer!\nThis time, motivated to complete all the adventures I had missed in 2016, I moved to Malta for two months. It gave me the time to dive deeper into each island, so I dedicate this blog post todiving inGozoafter writing aboutdiving in Maltaand Comino. For 3 weeks in May, I went diving around the island to photograph all the bestrecreational dive sites. As I explored some of them up to 3 times, here is an overview of the diving scene in Gozo, which 100% shore diving.\nDiving in Gozoat a glance\nThis time, I logged 14 dives all around Gozo (i.e. way more than in Malta). Here are three main diving areas in Gozo:\nAmong my top 5 diving spots in Gozo, please note some locations are suitable for beginners, and others are for advanced divers due to depth. All the dive sites mentioned in this article are shore dives. The island of Gozo being relatively small, any dive centre can visit any dive site daily, weather permitting,  so it doesn\u2019t matter where you stay.\nHere is a video summary of my dives in Gozo:\nGozo is also a paradise for tech and even rebreather divers, especially with the newly inauguratedXlendi archaeological parkbelow 100 m deep. For information, this remarkable site can only be visited with accredited dive centres. Through them, you pay a fee to Heritage Malta, the governmental organisation conserving historical sites.\nMy dive parameters:\nWhile I\u2019m the first to recognise thatcalling a dive site Blue Hole is excellent marketing, it\u2019s impossible not to love diving inGozo Blue Hole. For good and bad reasons, this sinkhole of Gozo\u2019s west coast, is a hell of a dive site! The good news? It is a diverse and exciting cavern dive that even beginner divers can fully enjoy. The bad news? You better be in good shape to approach the edge of the Blue Hole.\nFirst, no matter where you start in Gozo, prepare your scuba gear efficiently so the van of your dive centre can leave early. Efficient divers get the best parking spots in Dwejra and save up a few extra efforts. Once fully equipped, with a tank on your back, there is a bit of walking,going up and down stairs, stepping from one rock to another, for about 5 minutes. When you think you\u2019ve done the hardest, you\u2019ll need to walk over what I call \u201cthe ice rink\u201d to reach the edge of the Blue Hole. It\u2019s a shallow rocky bottom where thin algae grow. You now get the idea:it\u2019s slippery. Even the smallest waves can worsen things as you won\u2019t see through the surface where you put your booty. Count 5 extra minutes to do this safely.\nThese conditions haven\u2019t changed in 7 years. But in the meantime, the Azure Window, the elegant arch that used to be in the background of the Blue Hole, collapsed. It used to be the number one attraction of Gozo Island. Guess what happens with the crowds remaining the same in Dwejra: everyone wants to see the Blue Hole now. It was my biggest shock because people used to not even give a da** about it, to the point I even wondered if they knew it was there. Now, you\u2019ll have to trek with 30 kg of gear on your back whileslaloming between touristswho have no clue how dangerous it is for us if we fall. So, be extra careful; it\u2019s not a race, and dive instructors are often happy to help. Keep thinking, \u201cbaby steps\u201d.\nNow, about the diving itself. Once you\u2019re on the edge of the Blue Hole, you\u2019ll feel relief as the best way is to inflate your BCD, keep your fins in your hand, turn 180\u00b0 and let you fall in the water (make sure nobody\u2019s behind). Floating comfortably at the surface, you can finish putting your fins, mask, hood and gloves on, aming the bubbles of the divers on their way back. The entry and exit point is indeed the same.\nAt only 7 m deep, the Blue Hole offers its first surprise: a long underwater arch covered in orange sponges and anemones. Once your eyes get used to the lower light, you can realise the arch is agiant window allowing access to the outer reef. Only 15 m deep, the Blue Hole is only one part of the dive. On a sunny day, this first shallow part can be mesmerising with the rays of sun penetrating the surface and a blue halo coming from this window.\nThe second part of the dive was a total rediscovery for me. In 2016, the Azure Window was still standing. It used to be a relaxed wall dive, which point was only to get a glimpse of the Azure Window from underneath. I often heard how exciting the dive site wasafter the Azure Window collapsed: indeed, it is!\nThe arch broke into giant, pyramid-shaped blocks, forming anexciting maze of straight-lined caverns. In less than a decade, the surface of these blocks on the outside is now covered in seaweed. Diving in the Blue Hole with a macro lens on your camera is a thing now since it is now a nudibranch paradise. Be careful, the overlapping of the blocks can make you lose your orientation and quickly find yourself at depths you don\u2019t want to go.\nMy favourite part remains when you return inside the Blue Hole. Before ascending to the surface, you can explore thetunnel hiding in the dark, at the bottom of the chimney. The tunnel isn\u2019t so special, but once you make a u-turn, you get abreath-taking vertical overview of the Blue Hole. On a sunny day, the safety stop in the \u201ceye\u201d of the Blue Hole is beautiful too, especially with mauve stingers (jellyfish), floating around in spring.\nIt would be a shame to miss diving the Blue Hole. Make sure you stay on Gozo for a few days.When the winds blow from the west, it\u2019s impossible (dangerous) to access the Blue Holeas the waves crash on the cliffs of Dwejra. It\u2019s unfortunately hard to predict more than 24 to 48 hours before. And this is precisely what happened to me the very first time I went to Gozo. So in 2016, I had to organise a day trip. Lesson learnt: I stayed enough time to dive it twice this time!\nMy dive parameters: max depth 21 m \u2013 dive time 76 min \u2013 water temperature 17\u00b0C\nIt was already my second favourite dive site the first time I went diving in Gozo. And whilethe access is completely differentthan what I experienced, it is now safer and maybe even more beautiful. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s even possible, but dive sites apparently get better over the years in Gozo.\nVans and pick-up trucks of dive centres are now parking on the top ofWied il-Ghasri, a dramatic gorge zigzagging to the sea over 300 m. The 26 m high cliff overlooks a narrow cove with a tiny pebble beach where the water entry point is. Once more, your fitness level is vital to enjoy this dive comfortably. This time, though, it\u2019s only on the way back:  you have to climb up about 100 steps fully equipped with the tank on your back.\nAs you\u2019ll see on my dive parameters, we went for an hour and 20 minutes of diving. Why? Because on the way to the cave, it was anudibranch festival(cf. pictures of \u201cwhat to see underwater?\u201d) with some of the most exciting species and perfectly positioned every time. So, I had to get my macro lens out of my pocket every time!  We reached the entrance of Cathedral Cave only 30 minutes after getting in the water (it should take about 10 minutes).\nOnly an experienced guide will find the cave entrance because it doesn\u2019t look like much at the beginning. There is no clue about the natural phenomenon you\u2019re about to witness.Surfacing inside the cave is possibleas a hole constantly brings fresh air. The echo of the cavern and theblue light coming from underneathis just incredible. I explored many dive sites around the world named \u201cCathedral\u201d, but none gave the feeling of being truly in a church.\nMy dive parameters:\nSometimes, the best way to explain a dive site that requires top-notchplanning and orientation skillsis to fail. Indeed, we just couldn\u2019t find it on my first tentative of diving at Double Arch. To be fair, we got a decent swell and low visibility that day. But at least I understood what we did wrong the first time.\nThe views ofXwejni Baywhile you prepare your tank are stunning. The northern coast of Gozo is the most scenic of the island, with its saltpans looking like lace carved in golden rocks. The access to the water is only a short walk, but careful not to slip on the slipway covered in seaweed. BCD fully inflated, you can finish adjusting your fins floating at the surface, but don\u2019t put on your mask yet as you\u2019re in for quite a surface swim.\nSwimming on your back is the best option; while not necessarily the most efficient, it\u2019s the only way to keep an eye on your bearing points, especially the red door above the salt pans. It takes about15 minutes of swimming. There used to be an easier way by walking across the salt pans, but it\u2019s now forbidden. The process is safer using a compass, but natural orientation also helps. Perfectly aligned with the red door, you should be at the ideal point to descend over a 10 m deep seagrass meadow.\nThen, you take the opposite direction of the shore until you find the edge of the wall. The trick is to watch your depth. If the edge is at 14 m, the double arch is on your right; if you\u2019re already at 17 m, it\u2019s on your left. The double arch is, on average,30 m deep. If you go any deeper than 35 m, you missed it. This is what happened to my buddy team on our first attempt.\nThe second time, it was exhilarating to finally find it. This time, it was only the instructor and I, and we got the entire site to ourselves. The most surprising was seeing you can only distinguish the arches once you\u2019re meters away. No wonder it\u2019s tricky to find. But once there, it\u2019s really a one-of-a-kind geological formation. I had never seen anything like it before. The arches are pretty wide, so it\u2019smore like a cavern on top of another one. The upper one is covered in seagrass, while the lower one is above a sandy bottom about 34 m deep (I didn\u2019t go there to keep some non-deco time for my pictures).\nI stayed in the space between the two arches. With a deep blue halo in the background, shining my dive light at the ceiling, I could reveal an orange patchwork of sponges and anemones. A sizablered scorpionfishwas quietly lying on the lower arch, taking the pose for my camera. Watching the non-deco time on my dive computer flying by, I had to make choices photo-wise. It was a bit frustrating; I\u2019m sure there were many natural treasures to find. For sure, this is a dive site you can explore repeatedly and it will never be twice the same dive.\nImportant to know: in the event of a swell,the waves that form to the right of Xwejni Bay are potentially dangerous(it\u2019s a surfing hotspot), so it\u2019s also essential to manage your navigation correctly on the way back; otherwise, you\u2019ll find yourself battling to return to shore.\nMy dive parameters: max depth 29 m \u2013 dive time 65 min \u2013 water temperature 17\u00b0C\nIf you are diving at the Blue Hole, this is the usual combo for the day\u2019s second dive. If you\u2019re at least an Advanced Open Water diver and plan on going deep,you usually do it before the Blue Hole. The wall after the tunnel drops to approximately 60 m deep.\nIf you wonder why such a name, it\u2019s because the dive starts ina seawater lake on the inland side of the cliff. A narrow tunnel makes the water communicate with the open sea. To be fair, it is more a pond than a lake. From there, the boat tours leave to see Dwejra cliffs and the Blue Hole from the sea. This detail is substantial as it means you should expect boat traffic at the tunnel\u2019s surface, meaning extreme care of not being too shallow (minimum 5 m deep) to avoid an accident.\nIt only takes a minute to enter the tunnel, and I quickly understood why it\u2019s a favourite among divers in Gozo. Again, a spectacular blue halo mesmerise us. But this time, due to the length and height (about 15 m) of the tunnel, anarrow strip of blue lightforms in the dark. Bringing a dive light is highly recommended !\nThe rest of the dive is a wall dive, left or right shoulder. Depending on divers\u2019 wishes, several routes can be taken to visit a series of caverns and canyons boasting marine life. I plead guilty that I couldn\u2019t got far because I took too many pictures. What I saw was so pretty that I have zero regrets. These tiny caverns covered inbright red false coralwere so photogenic with the deep blue background. I guess this is another dive you can do over and over again without getting bored; possibilities seem to be quite endless there.\nMy dive parameters:\nThis is another proof that shallow dive sites have nothing to be ashamed of. I missed it on my first time in Gozo, and since I was staying in Xlendi, literally meters away from the water entry, I took the opportunity to do it twice. This site is used for divers on training but also as abackup plan when the weather is a bit difficultsince Xlendi Bay is a long, sheltered cove.\nFrom the dive centre, there is a bit of walking across the terraces of the restaurants along the water (I just loved the look of the clients seeing us passing by fully equipped), but this is toavoid a long underwater swim and save on air. The small stairs carved into the rocks lead to the entry point almost in front of the tunnel entrance.\nIt\u2019s an easy descent, and as you cross the cove underwater, look for theflying gurnardson the sand patches among the seagrass. The tunnel\u2019s entrance is pretty shallow, around 5 m deep, covered in this purple seaweed that looks like lilac (red sea plume). You have to know where it is, but it wasn\u2019t an issue to find it myself the second time we went there.\nThe first part of the tunnel is a rather dark cavern, soa dive light is necessary. The second part is where the magic happens: the tunnel\u2019s ceiling is above the water, and if you dive there before noon, the light will flood the tunnel with mesmerising reflections under the water\u2019s surface.\nLast but not least, the rocky reef outside the tunnel is a nudibranch festival. With an eagle-eye dive instructor in love with nudibranchs, too, this is where we found some of the most exciting species in Malta. And this is why I returned a second time, just to inspect every piece of seaweed I could! Best find :Hope\u2019s elysia& Pico\u2019s Okenia.\nNow you know my favourite spots, I wanted to give you more information about the other sites I had the opportunity to explore while diving in Gozo. Due to a capricious weather, I couldn\u2019t do two famous dive sites of Gozo, Billinhurst Cave and the MV Cominoland shipwreck. Note a new wreck has joined the shores of Gozo, the Hephaestus. A reason to come back to Gozo one more time? I guess!\nIt is an easy shore dive site with some underwater swimming (about 10 minutes). The goal is to swim around the rocky pinnacles between 25 and 10 m deep. There is a bit of everything for everyone here. Going to the furthest point, between 15 and 20 m deep, you will likely see the dentex hunting in the blue. If you stick to the wall, you\u2019ll probably find many macro critters such as nudibranchs, flatforms or blennies. It\u2019s a great dive site to train in underwater photography, but I\u2019m not such a fan of equipping in the salty mud of this old saltpan.\nThe staircase of the Karwela is what made this shipwreck famous in Gozo, and let\u2019s even say in the entire Maltese archipelago. But it\u2019s smaller than it seems (blame it on wide-angle lenses). I really liked this shipwreck, but due to the swimming time and the depth, once on the wreck, it\u2019s a race against the clock if you don\u2019t want to end up with 10 minutes of decompression. I did it twice to have all the pictures I wanted: the staircase, the engine room (34 m deep) and the propellers (42m deep).\nNeighbour to the Karwela, this shipwreck has the same constraints of swimming time and depth. Interestingly, the ship is upside down since things didn\u2019t go well when it was scuttled. But in the end, seeing its large propeller on top makes it an exciting sight. But gosh, it was a long swim (and facing current) along its hull with barely anything to see until I found the propeller \u2013 the ship is 80 m long. One dive is more than enough, except if you have deep diving training goals.\nThe number one beginner site in Gozo. This shallow cove has a little bit of everything: sandy bottom, seagrass meadow and two small caverns. It\u2019s not the most exciting dive, but it\u2019s perfect for a check dive with flying gurnards, flounders and cuttlefish. However, if you know where to look, this is the seahorse hotspot of Gozo. No luck for me, unfortunately.\nGozo belongs to the southmost country of Europe between Sicily and Tunisia, Malta. ItsMediterranean marine lifeis representative of what can be seen in Spain, France and Italy, and not like Greece or Turkey, as one might think. However, there is no underwater forest of red and yellow gorgonians or large groupers in Gozo but a wealth of caverns and nudibranchs.\nI summed up below the mostcommon fish speciesI saw in the waters of the Maltese Islands, from the most common to the one-time encounters. I included those I saw while diving in Gozo but also Malta, and Comino, as you will likely see them all around the archipelago.\nFrom anudibranchpoint of view, Gozo is surprisingly a paradise for underwater macro photographers. They seem to love both caverns and shipwrecks. Spots the seaweeds and hydroids moving with the currents, and you\u2019ll find them.\nOthernotable marine specieswhile diving in the Maltese islands:\nImportant note about the fireworms: they\u2019re pretty with their bright orange and red colours, but make sure you never touch those! Their name is the warning. Their sting doesn\u2019t hurt, it burns! There is an incredible amount of them on every dive site. Besides, these little sneaky b******s tend to fall from walls or shipwrecks on your hands or neck, so always carefully approach any surface underwater.\nIt took me 3 trips to Malta, but I got it right this time! I now have the perfect place to stay in Gozo, and on top of this,one of the best dive centres on the islandwas just down my flat: I\u2019m talking about Xlendi, only 10 minutes by bus from Victoria, the main town of the island, going west.\nSaint Andrew\u2019s Divers Covehas been aninstitution on Gozo Island for over 30 years. I dived with them on my first trip to Gozo, and this is naturally with them I went back diving in Gozo as I knew it meant being part of a big international scuba diving family. Mark, the Maltese owner, and his wife Nathalie, French, welcome an international crowd of scuba divers from all over the world thanks to their team of English and French instructors and others coming for the season from all over Europe each year.\nScuba divers come in the morning usually at 8.30 am to prepare their gear they place in theirassigned box. Then, depending on the scuba divers\u2019 levels and wishes, they are spread in different pick-up trucks and vans to go to different corners of the island, weather permitting. You are generally done after 2 dives at 2 pm, shower included.\nThe village of Xlendi is a former fishermen\u2019s village nestled in a cove with a high cliff on one side and ancient saltpans on the other. Known for its seafood restaurants, besides scuba diving, it\u2019s the perfect point to go on different hiking trails. I stayed in Xlendi for more than 2 weeks and loved how easy it was to enjoy the island\u2019s natural side or go to town by bus for cultural events and shopping.\nYes, it is! If you consider passing your Open Water certification to become a scuba diver, go for it. Thanks to a great choice ofaccessible shore diving sitesand the range of depth available, it is less stressful to learn basic skills.\nThe best locations for beginners areIx-Xini in MgarrandXlendi Bay. Located in sheltered coves, these dive sites are shallow enough for beginners. The advantage of shore diving is that you won\u2019t risk seasickness, have more space to prepare your gear, and can remain as shallow as you feel comfortable. Note some shore dive sites in Gozo sometimes require a sporty approach, on land or swimming, but this is not the case for the dive sites above.\nFor Open Water divers looking toexpand their dive skills, Gozo is a great place to experience deep diving, wreck diving or cavern diving with dive sites with increasing difficulty. After a check-dive in Mgarr Ix-Xini, you can go to Xlendi Tunnel and Ras-il-Hobz (Middle Finger), and if you feel comfortable, you can plan for the Blue Hole and Inland Sea.\nThe scuba diving season in Gozo and Malta is usuallyfrom March to November, but several dive centres remain open all year long. With an average water temperature of 18\u00b0C, you can dive in Gozo in a wetsuit anytime. Even in the winter, with stronger winds, thanks to its numerous shore dive sites around the island,scuba divers can find a sheltered spot every day.\nFrom the end of April to the second half of May, I saw the temperature increase by almost 1\u00b0C every week. Sometimes, the wind could bring back colder water, but I went from 16\u00b0C to 19\u00b0C in 3 weeks. Regarding water temperatures, bringing a semi-dry suit was an excellent choice for this temperature level.\nThe first time I dived in the Maltese Islands was at the end of July. That year, the water temperature was colder than usual, around 20\u00b0C. I wore a 5 mm full wetsuit with a hood, gloves and booties with a warm undersuit below, and I still felt a bit cold. Usually,in the summertime, water temperatures are 24 to 25\u00b0C.\nSeptember is the best time to go diving in Gozoif you want warm water and the best visibility while enjoying a shoulder season. Water has heated up all summer, and you can dive without the crowds and with lower accommodation prices.\nOnce you\u2019re in Europe, getting to Malta couldn\u2019t be easier. There aredirect flights from virtually every main city in Europe. I flew from Paris and flew back to Marseille! Plenty of options from the UK, with flights from all London airports, but also Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and many more. You\u2019ll find something similar for Germany, Spain, Italy, and many other European countries. To find at which dates you can find thebest prices on flights, you can easily compare prices ontrip.com.\nIf you don\u2019t feel like flying, there is a possibility of going there byferry from Palermo or Pozzallo in Sicily, Italy. To get there, note there is anight train going from Rome to Palermo, Sicily(including an incredible cross-over of the Messina Strait of the train on a ferry, yes, you read correctly). As you can see, I looked into the details, but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t make it this time\nOnce in Malta, you have the choice between the fast ferry from Valletta or the slow ferry from Cirkewwa to go diving in Gozo. If you\u2019rerenting a car in Malta(thebest prices are from Luqa airport), then the only option is to drive all the way up north to Cirkewwa and take the slow ferry (only 20 minutes, but you might not be able to hop on the first one due to traffic). Don\u2019t be surprised if you go directly without paying anything; the fare is paid on the way back (4,65 \u20ac as of 2023).\nIf you\u2019re not renting a car, I discovered a new option on my way back from Gozo to Malta: thefast ferry linking Valletta directly to Gozoin 45 minutes only. I found the fare quite reasonable (7 \u20ac as of 2023). Since I took the slow ferry on my way to Gozo and returned with the fast ferry, I only paid 7 \u20ac.\nNote for the budget travellers, you can also reach Cirkewwa by bus. It takes 1h30 with line 41/42 from Valletta bus terminal (2 \u20ac ticket when bought directly in the bus, but you can also buy a7-day unlimited bus passfor 21 \u20ac which can also be used in Gozo).Malta Public Transportoffers many different packages, including the fast ferry to Gozo, so have a look as it might be cheaper and you could save a lot of time too.\nI tried 3 different types of accommodation in Gozo: a 4-star hotel inXlendiand a farmhouse B&B inNadurat the beginning and the end of my stay on the island. In between, I stayed at one of the studio apartments above the dive centre (gotta love the compressor as the alarm clock!).\nIdeally located in the centre of Xlendi Bay, theSt Patrick\u2019s Hoteloffers simple but comfortable rooms with balconies with either views of the village (beautiful sunrise in the morning) or sea view (but no direct sunset). Even if your room is on the village side, don\u2019t hesitate to have a drink on their rooftop garden to enjoy thebest view in Xlendi(except maybe for the adventurous ones who manage to reach the top of Xlendi cliff).\nThis family-run hotel is not necessarily the idea you might have of what a 4-star hotel should be, but I loved the location and thebreakfast on their terrace by the seain the morning with pastizzi (Maltese puff pastries). Obviously, having the dive centre just across the street was a big plus, on the days you are diving in Gozo. Note: I stayed in the hotel right before they started refurbishment work. So please, if you stay there and have pictures, send them my way; I\u2019d love to see what they have done with the place.\nI wanted to experience it after my first visit to Gozo. Back in 2016, renting an entire farm house with a swimming pool was possible for an affordable price. This is not the case anymore. So, even by sharing with my buddy, it was over our budget. We were so happy to findSunny Villain Nadur, acharming farmhouse rented by the room. It was so tastefully decorated. We had a giant private terrace, a shared kitchen where the owner served breakfast in the morning, and a swimming pool in the backyard. Bonus point: it was located next to the best bakery in Gozo, Mekren\u2019s Bakery, where you can order a delicious veggie Gozitan ftira for 9 \u20ac (ftira is the Gozitan take on pizza).\nIt was mybest experience accommodation-wisein Gozo. However, you\u2019ll need a car to stay there if you are diving in Gozo at the same time (even if going by bus is feasible, you\u2019ll have to stop in Victoria to change buses; it would be a pretty long ride before the morning meet-up time). In my case,I rented a carbut also stayed in Nadur once I was done diving to explore the rest of the island, like theTal-Mixta cave, only 10 minutes away from Sunny Villa.\nIs something still missing from this article?

        "content": "Who would have thought I would need 3 trips to Malta to find thebest itinerary to visit the smallest country in the EUas a scuba diver? There are so many tempting dive sites around the islands that if you want to indulge in the wealth of culture on offer, you\u2019d better be organised to make the most of your time. Thanks to my 2-month stay in Malta, I was able to try out just about everything there, and only picked the best for a 2-week stay, including one week 100% dedicated to scuba diving.\nMy itinerary will take you across the 3 main islands:Malta, Comino and Gozo. Feel free to adjust the time dedicated todiving in Maltaif you want to spend more time underwater. Be aware the country is only 316 km\u00b2, so even on the same day, it\u2019s easy to balance it all and cover a lot of ground. Besides my favourite shipwrecks and cavern dives, you\u2019ll find here all my favourite addresses of where to eat and stay.\nPlan your underwater adventures in Malta with the interactive map below. It showcases the main attractions on Malta\u2019s main island, Comino and Gozo and theairport and the ferry terminalsto organise your trip. Note I did most of this itinerary byrenting a car. You will also find some of myfavourite shipwrecksand dive sites.\nI cannot think of a better way to start a trip to Malta than by its magnificent capital city, Valletta. The16th-century fortified citymay have streets perfectly aligned like Manhattan, it is still the smallest capital city in Europe. However, chances are you\u2019ll be baffled like me by the density of treasures to be found corner after corner. No wonderthe entire city of Valletta is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Note, if there is something I learned from my previous stay in Valletta, the best way to enjoy Malta\u2019s capital city is by staying in Sliema, its neighbour city.\nThere is so much to see that you could spend an entire week exploring every street, garden and church. However, to make time for the epic diving awaiting you around the Maltese Islands, here are my personal highlights for a 2-day visit.\nIf you had time only for one thing in Valletta, that would be my pick, plus it\u2019s free. With a perfect mix of architecture, flowers and views, you can\u2019t go wrong by visiting theUpper Barakka & Lower Barakka gardenson the east side (the best spots to be early morning). If you are looking for the perfect viewpoint for a selfie, I recommend getting to the west side at the golden hour (1 hour before sunset). Go to the end of theHastings Gardenuntil you find a small parking lot. This is where you have a perfect alignment of Valletta landmarks in the background.\nI didn\u2019t have the time to visit any museum this time as two conferences kept me busy (but I got to see the old campus of the University of Malta thanks to the Rebreather Forum, so there is that!). I kept a fantastic memory of visiting theGrandmaster Palaceand theSt Elmo Fortfrom my previous visit. These two are thebest way to learn about Malta\u2019s historyand understand why Malta became became so famous for wreck diving. During Easter celebrations, I revisited the St John Co-Cathedral, a jewel of Baroque architecture. I also still have a keen thing for Saint Paul\u2019s shipwreck church (it celebrates Malta\u2019s first famous shipwreck).\nMore about museums & monuments in myweekend in Vallettablog post.\nWhile I found Valletta pretty sleepy in 2016, things have significantly changed. It\u2019s almost a party every night on the steps ofSt Ursula, St John and St Lucia streets. People enjoy drinks, pizza and an occasional open-air karaoke on the stone steps lighted by suspended glass chandeliers. If you want a table (or a cushion!), it\u2019s better to come before sunset. My go-to address for cocktails, wine and pizza : 33 Steps (185, St Lucia Street).\nTaking the ferry between Valletta and Sliema is the best way to commute while enjoying the best view of the Valletta skyline, especially at the golden hour. What I discovered the first time and confirmed the second is that Sliema is way more than a place to sleep. Beyond having thelargest concentration of dive centres in Malta, its charming streets and rocky beaches made my 1-month stay a delight.\nI guess it\u2019s my best travel tip of Malta: if you fancy taking pictures instreets lined up with colourful doors and Maltese balconies, Sliema is a much better setting than Valletta. I recommend the area between Stella Maris and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart churches. My favourite spot was the cross-over between Saint Marin, Sir Adrian Dingli and Kbira streets and its iconic British red phone box below a tree.\nSliema has a beautiful6 km long seafront promenadeoverlooking its golden rocky beaches. Carved into the globigerina limestone, at the Fond Ghadir beach, you\u2019ll even find pools that were made in the 19thcentury but got named the \u201cRoman Baths\u201d.\nOf all my pleasant morning or evening walks, the most stunning is definitely Tign\u00e9 Point.The view of Valletta is breathtaking at twilight, after sunset, when the lights are switched on. Note that Tign\u00e9 Point used to be a canon battery of the British troops who left in the 1960s, so you\u2019ll find many surprising shapes carved in the rocks where the canons used to be. Access is straightforward from the walking board near The Point, a shopping mall.\nEvery time I went eating out, Sliema never disappointed. The variety of restaurants is just baffling, and the prices are more than decent. But if you\u2019re not staying a month like I did, take the opportunity to focus on the Maltese gastronomy restaurants.\nI have two addresses, approved by locals,Ta\u2019Karolina\u2013 151 Tower Road \u2013 andGululu\u2013 133 Spinola Bay (this one is actually in St Julians, which is close enough). Any meal usually starts with a platter of Maltese \u201ctapas\u201d such as sheep milk cheeselets, olives, sun-dried tomatoes and white beans. The influence of Italy is never too far, as many dishes involve pasta but with a Maltese twist (I passed on the Rabbit sauce, but loved the raviolis & pasta with cheese and olives, or sometimes cappers).\nNot only are there excellent shore dive sites right in the heart of Sliema (Tugboat II), but since most of the diving in Malta is shore diving, dive centres drive you all around the island no matter where you stay (so better to stay in a lively and charming area, right?). I recommend planning forat least 3 days of diving, including 2 in Zurieq (UM El Faroud shipwreck) and Cirkewwa (P29 & Rozy shipwrecks). While diving at the UM El Faroud, the #1 wreck dive in Malta, make sure to stop at theBlue Grotto viewpointon your way in or your way back.\nLearn more aboutscuba diving in Malta.\nNo hesitation this time. Stay away from Saint Paul\u2019s Bay and stay in Sliema. It\u2019s central, next to Valletta, with plenty of yummy and reasonably priced restaurants, direct access to a lovely long seafront promenade, and all the best dive centres are a short walk away. Since I worked remotely in Malta for an extended time, I rented an apartment for a month. However, for 2 nights before and after, I tried two different types of accommodation: a hostel and a luxury resort. This way, you can pick what fits your budget!\nAll adventurers deserve a treat! After a 2-week marathon of conferences and an intense week of wreck diving, when I gave back the keys of my flat in Sliema,I couldn\u2019t dream of a better place to staythan theAX Palacein the heart of Sliema. If you can, pay the extra to get a room on the upper floors becausethe views of Valletta from the balcony are incredible at sunrise and sunset. My room was incredibly tastefully decorated, and the bed was a dream.\nTheoutdoor rooftop poolwas perfect for a refreshing swim and a cocktail. In the evening, the indoor pool, with its sauna and hammam, was the cherry on top of my relaxing stopover before moving to Gozo. While I wasn\u2019t too impressed with the breakfast, I booked a table one night at their Asian restaurant on the rooftop next to the pool. Whether you like eating Thai, Indian, Japanese, or a mix of everything, they have it all, and it tastes as it should, and the service is top-notch. Top tip: when booking the table, ask for a table near the windows with views of Valletta.\nWaiting for my flat to be available, I booked 2 nights in a hostel inSt Julian\u2019s near Sliema. I thought it was the best way to start my stay in Malta as hostels are usually fantastic places to meet with other travellers and gather valuable tips.\nAnd this is precisely how it went atMalti hostel. I must admit, I picked this one because they also offered private rooms at a great price (40\u20ac a night in April), it was close to Balluta Bay, and they have a jacuzzi on their rooftop. Well, I discovered later the water of the jacuzzi was pretty cold, and in the chilly temperatures of April, I couldn\u2019t stay longer than 5 min! Anyway, I love thecosy living room and kitchen that worked perfectly to socialise with the other guests, even if my room was in another building, but literally next door.\nIf you have already searched about what to see in Malta, you surely stumbled upon the50 shades of blue of Comino Blue Lagoon. When I went for the first in the middle of the summer in 2016, there was already a bit of a crowd, but it was nothing to compare to the craziness I saw even at the beginning of spring now (note water is between 16 and 17\u00b0C at that time of the year). So, while there is no denying it is a beautiful spot worth seeing,finding a way to do it differently will be a game changerin your experience.\nIf you still want to take one of the boats leaving from Sliema, St Paul\u2019s Bay or Mgarr in Gozo to visit the island independently, at least do it a weekday andavoid weekends at all costs, and if possible, in the shoulder season (the best time would be June or September). Share your time between the lagoon and hiking the rest of the island (beautiful cliffs on its northern shore).\nI went this time on a scuba diving boat from Malta and the other time on a kayak from Gozo. Feel free to move around this day on your itinerary depending on whether you visit Comino from Malta\u2019s main island or Gozo.\nSinceDive Systems Malta, the dive centre I was diving with in Malta, also had a boat at the quay of their sister dive centre in St Julian, we sailed off directly for an exciting boat diving trip in Comino. We explored theP31 shipwreck(the best wreck dive for beginners) and theSanta Maria Caves(allowing us to see the cliffs of the northern shore at the same time from the sea). We stopped at theblue lagoon for our surface interval, and I must say it was delightful to enjoy it with a cup of coffee from the boat\u2019s sun deck.\nLearn more aboutdiving in Comino.\nIt was the best way to enjoy Comino\u2019s splendid coastline away from the crowd while slowly appreciating the details: the beauty of thearches and the narrow canyons in transparent turquoise watercan only be seen from a kayak. I joined a guided tour withGozo Adventuresfrom Hondoq Harbour. We went for 4 hours, including crossing the channel between Gozo and Comino (twice! I\u2019m still impressed I managed to do it). The tour included a1-hour stop at the Blue Lagoonso we could take a few pictures and then escape paddling away.\nDon\u2019t make the same mistake I did on my first diving trip to Malta, and stay at least a few days on the archipelago\u2019s second-largest island. I can bet you\u2019ll be as much charmed as me byits nature, authenticity and gastronomy, and wish you would have stayed longer. The excellent news about Gozo for scuba divers is that you can visit some of the most famous sights of the island on your daily dives, especially Djwera Bay (The Blue Hole & Inland Sea dive sites) and Xwejni saltpans (Double Arch & Cathedral dive sites).\nI listed below my top selection of places you won\u2019t see if you only go scuba diving. They should be on your itinerary for a balanced overview of the island. In that case, the best thing to do is to go on a mini-road trip for a day or two.\nThe city is located right in the centre of Gozo, and from its highest point, the Citadella, you have a360\u00b0 view of the entire island. Victoria deserves to spend at least half a day packed with things to see. Its centralised bus terminal connects to every corner of the island so you can quickly come to town by bus (it took me only 10 minutes from Xlendi), or if you rent a car, it\u2019s easy to park near the bus terminal. From there, it takes 10 to 15 minutes to climb up to the Citadella.\nThe first part is built up, while the part in the back is the remaining ruins of a village. Entering the Citadella, you immediately face Gozo\u2019s Assumption of Our LadyCathedral at the top of a large, elegant flight of stairs. Around it is a choice of museums such as the Archeological Museum and the Gran Castello house (Ask for the special pass for Citadella \u2013 5\u20ac \u2013 or the entire island of Gozo \u2013 13\u20ac \u2013 and you will save on the total).\nOnce in the back, we can only witness thevillage ruins where Gozitans took refuge every summer when pirates used to attack. After a change of law in 1637, cramped houses were abandoned; they collapsed and were never rebuilt. However, the maze of cobblestone alleys still has its charm, and here and there, a few hidden gems deserve appreciation. The triple arch passageway is one of them. From there, you can access the highest part of the wall of the Citadella for a breathtaking bird-eye view of Gozo.\nThe perfect way to end your visit to Victoria is by heading for lunch or dinner around the Independence or St George squares, next to each other. My favourite address? Caf\u00e9 Jubilee, for a simple lunch with hearty traditional raviolis, a glass of gozo wine or a delicious homemade strawberry lemonade (Independance Square).\nThe collapse of the Azure Window left a big hole in the cliffs of Dwejra Bay and in the hearts of all Gozo lovers. But rejoice, not all is lost; the geology of Gozo had made this wonder of nature a twin that was kept away from most tourists\u2019 eyes so far. Reaching the Wied-il-Mielah arch on the northern shore of Gozo is undoubtedly a bit more adventurous.\nQuickly nicknamed the\u201cnew Azure Window\u201d, you\u2019ll find it at the end of a small country road through the stone-walled fields. You either need torent a car, or you\u2019re in for quite a hike since the nearest bus stop is at the Ta Pinu Basilica (40-minute walk each way).\nThe arch is at the end of a narrow canyon, so the best view is either from the stairs going down (be careful the guardrail is in poor condition) or from the top of the cliff a bit away from it (be even more cautious, no guardrail at all).\nI went three times to get a chance to get pictures with the best light and as few people as possible.The Instagram \u201csecret\u201d location is indeed not a secret anymore. But when I went for sunset, I don\u2019t blame people for turning in; it\u2019s a fabulous spot. Most people were respectful and rather respectful of everyone trying to get their dream selfie.\nYou cantry early morning, when the sun shines from behind the cave, lighting beautifully Ramla Bay, the golden sandy beach underneath. Unfortunately, the weather wasn\u2019t with me when I tried it, but it was indeed quieter. But on my last attempt at sunset, I realised that most people come by bus and stop relatively early. So, by coming to the cave in June when the sunset is the latest, you have more chances to have the cave for yourself if yourent a car.\nIf you\u2019re a foodie, you\u2019ll love Gozo. With olives, grapes and all sorts of fruits and vegetables growing locally, going ontasting tours in vineyards and farmsis something you must do while in Gozo. I took the opportunity to visitTal-Massar Wineryin Gharb andTa Mena Wineryin Xewkija.\nAt Tal-Massar, I had a full oenology session about Gozo wines in the middle of their vineyard. We tasted their entire range, fromcrisp floral whites to spicy full-bodied reds. At Ta-Mena, while their estate is on the road to Masalforn (which I visited too on my last day in Gozo), they have a shop and a tasting cellar next to where they produce wine and olive oil, which gives the opportunity to see the other side of the process. Named after the grandmother of the current owner, Marija, their estate produces many products on top of wine: it\u2019s the perfect place to shop for yummy souvenirs from Gozo. My favourites? The olive oil, thesweet tomato pasteand the lemon sea salt flakes.\nAnd as a final note, it is in Gozo that I found thebest local gastronomy restaurants. Here are my top 3 addresses:\nWhile Malta\u2019s main island is mostly about wreck diving, Gozo is theparadise of enthusiast cavern divers and nudibranch lovers(this second point came as a total surprise). If you only have a few days in Gozo, I recommend focusing on the 2 unique spots below, Dwejra Bay and Xwejni. But I recommend planning forat least 3 days of diving.\nLearn more aboutscuba diving in Gozo.\nThe world-famous Gozo Blue Hole is usually on every diver\u2019s list. Make sure to have time to appreciate the surrounding landscape by going on ashort walk to the top of the cliff overlooking the Blue Hole. Make sure to make it a 2-tank trip as the Inland Sea, right next door is a fantastic wall dive at the end of an impressive narrow and deep canyon. Both can be dived by beginner divers, but be aware of the sporty approach to the Blue Hole fully equipped.\nIt was my favourite spot on the island of Gozo in 2016, and it still is. Thesaltpans carved into the golden globigerina limestone form a mesmerising geological lace, especially from the viewpoint of Zebbug. The incredible dive sites off the saltpans\u2019 shores I could explore are Double Arch and Cathedral (but there are more). Double Arch is only for advanced and experienced deep divers, but Cathedral is fully accessible to beginner divers. The new access to the Cathedral is now fromWied-el-Ghasri, a stunning creek at the west end of Xwejni saltpans. While the water entry is much easier than I experienced, be aware of the 100 stairs you\u2019ll have to climb back after the dive.\nI tried 3 different types of accommodation in Gozo: a 4-star hotel in Xlendi and a farmhouse B&B in Nadur at the beginning and the end of my stay on the island. In between, I stayed at one of the studio apartments above the dive centre (gotta love the compressor as the alarm clock!).\nIdeally located in the centre of Xlendi Bay, theSt Patrick\u2019s Hoteloffers simple but comfortable rooms with balconies with either views of the village (beautiful sunrise in the morning) or sea view (but no direct sunset). Even if your room is on the village side, don\u2019t hesitate to have a drink on their rooftop garden to enjoy thebest view in Xlendi(except maybe for the adventurous ones who manage to reach the top of Xlendi cliff).\nThis family-run hotel is not necessarily the idea you might have of what a 4-star hotel should be, but I loved the location and thebreakfast on their terrace by the seain the morning with pastizzi (Maltese puff pastries). Having the dive centre just across the street was a big plus when diving in Gozo. Note: I stayed in the hotel right before they started refurbishment work. So please, if you stay there and have pictures, send them my way; I\u2019d love to see what they have done with the place.\nI wanted to experience it after my first visit to Gozo. Back in 2016, renting an entire farmhouse with a swimming pool was possible for an affordable price. This is not the case anymore. So, even by sharing with my buddy, it was over our budget. We were so happy to findSunny Villain Nadur, acharming farmhouse rented by the room. It was so tastefully decorated. We had a giant private terrace, a shared kitchen where the owner served breakfast in the morning, and a swimming pool in the backyard. Bonus point: it was located next to the best bakery in Gozo, Mekren\u2019s Bakery, where you can order a delicious veggie Gozitan ftira for 9 \u20ac (ftira is the Gozitan take on pizza).\nIt was mybest experience accommodation-wise in Gozo. However, you\u2019ll need a car to stay there if you are diving in Gozo at the same time (even if going by bus is feasible, you\u2019ll have to stop in Victoria to change buses; it would be a pretty long ride before the morning meet-up time). In my case,I rented a carbut also stayed in Nadur once I was done diving to explore the rest of the island, like the Tal-Mixta cave, only 10 minutes away from Sunny Villa.\nAs you return to the airport, why not spend your 24 hours of decompression before flying with a last road trip? Here is my favourite route along the moststunning natural spots and charming townsof Malta\u2019s main island. It\u2019s up to you to tailor your programme, visiting one or all of these spots, depending on how much time you have left.\nFrom Cirkewwa to Marsaxlokk, Malta shows a more natural side that many people often miss by only staying on the urbanised area of the northern coast where the capital city of Valletta is. Here are the top 4 spots I love to come back to again and again.\nCan we still call it a hidden gem? Maybe, maybe not. It was the first time I heard of it in 3 trips to Malta. I fell for this series of three bays (Golden Bay, Riviera Bay, Janina Bay) surrounded by dramatic hills and cliffs the first time I went there. I went back twice. It quickly became my favourite spot in the Maltese Islands (above the water). There you can swim, surf and hike!\nRiviera Bay might be the ultimate sunset spot on the main island of Malta. Note there is a beautiful and chill restaurant at the beach level (Singita Miracle Beach). Still, I recommend first hiking to thetop of the hill above the Qarraba peninsulafor an unforgettable sunset. Be careful in June when sunsets are pretty late; the restaurant stops serving food at 8 pm. At worst, you can also head back to Golden Bay, to theRadisson Blu Hotel. Their restaurant, Agliolio, is open to the public and has delicious pizzas with gourmet recipes, and they close at 10 pm.\nThe charm ofMalta\u2019s ancient capital(until 1530) deserves a couple of hours to stroll in its narrow streets punctuated with painted doors and blooming flowers. And if my pictures below weren\u2019t enough, what if I told you you can eat the best cakes in Malta there? At Fontanella Tea Garden (1 Bastion Street), you can choose among 20 recipes of homemade cakes (I loved the almond pistachio one, even if I had to take half away since the slice is enormous). On top of yummy treats, their terrace offers a beautiful view of Malta\u2019s northern coast.\nThe Dingli Cliffs areMalta\u2019s unexpected highest point of altitude(253 m, yes, not that much, but still).  Forming an almost perfect straight line, the best viewpoint is obviously from the sea. Still, one vantage point allows a fantastic partial side view of the vertiginous cliffs. One important thing: even on a bright sunny day, the cliffs tend to catch the humidity, and with the warm winds from Northern Africa,clouds form rapidly there. As a result, the cliffs can be completely engulfed in mist sometimes. That\u2019s what happened on my second visit, which was finally sunny. All I got was 15 minutes before the cliffs disappeared for the next hour.\nScuba divers usually have the opportunity to see theBlue Grottoon their way to go diving at the UM El Faroud in Zurieq. If you haven\u2019t seen it, make sure to go, it is an iconic natural site of Malta. The Blue Grotto is a 15 minute drive further down the coast from the Dingli Cliffs viewpoint. And for those who have already been to Blue Grotto, make a stop atGhar Lapsifor a swim. The dive itself didn\u2019t impress me much, but the natural pool did!\nIt was a must-see for this trip, as I could never make it to Marsaxlokk on my previous trips to Malta. The \u201charbour of the south\u201c, as its name means in Maltese, is featured on every postcard from Malta due to its numerous colourful luzzu boats that local fishermen still use. Famous for itsfarmer market and seafood restaurants, I was happy to return on a Sunday when the market is real (the rest of the weeks, it\u2019s only some tourist souvenir stalls). It took me 45 minutes to walk from one end to the other! Fresh fruits, vegetables, cheese, breads, pastries, sweets, fish, and so on\u2026 everything the Maltese islands produce is on the Sunday market. Make sure to make your restaurant reservation for lunch before hitting the market, or you\u2019ll have to wait until 2 pm to find a table available.\nOnce you\u2019re in Europe, getting to Malta couldn\u2019t be easier. There aredirect flights from virtually every central city in Europe. I flew from Paris and flew back to Marseille! Plenty of options from the UK, with flights from all London airports, but also Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and many more. You\u2019ll find something similar for Germany, Spain, Italy, and many other European countries. To find at which dates you can find thebest prices on flights, you can easily compare prices ontrip.com.\nIf you don\u2019t feel like flying, there is a possibility of going there byferry from Palermo or Pozzallo in Sicily, Italy. To get there, note there is anight train going from Rome to Palermo, Sicily (including an incredible cross-over of the Messina Strait of the train on a ferry, yes, you read correctly). As you can see, I looked into the details, but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t make it this time.\nOnce in Malta, you can choose between the fast ferry from Valletta or the slow ferry from Cirkewwa to go diving in Gozo. If you\u2019rerenting a car in Malta(thebest prices are from Luqa airport), then the only option is to drive all the way up north to Cirkewwa and take the slow ferry (only 20 minutes, but you might not be able to hop on the first one due to traffic). Don\u2019t be surprised if you go directly without paying anything; the fare is paid on the way back (4,65 \u20ac as of 2023).\nIf you\u2019re not renting a car, I discovered a new option on my way back from Gozo to Malta: thefast ferry linking Valletta directly to Gozoin 45 minutes only. I found the fare quite reasonable (7 \u20ac as of 2023). Since I took the slow ferry on my way to Gozo and returned with the fast ferry, I only paid 7 \u20ac.\nNote for the budget travellers, you can also reach Cirkewwa by bus. It takes 1h30 with line 41/42 from Valletta bus terminal (2 \u20ac ticket when bought directly in the bus, but you can also buy a7-day unlimited bus pass for 21 \u20ac, which can also be used in Gozo).Malta Public Transportoffers many different packages, including the fast ferry to Gozo, so have a look; it might be cheaper, and you could save a lot of time, too.\nThe scuba diving season in Malta is usuallyfrom March to November, but several dive centres remain open all year. With an average water temperature of 18\u00b0C, you can dive in Gozo in a wetsuit anytime. Even in the winter, with stronger winds, thanks to its numerous shore dive sites around the island,scuba divers can find a sheltered spot every day.\nFrom the end of April to the second half of May, I saw the temperature increase by almost 1\u00b0C every week. Sometimes, the wind could bring back colder water, but I went from 16\u00b0C to 19\u00b0C in 3 weeks. Regarding water temperatures, bringing a semi-dry suit was an excellent choice for this temperature level.\nThe first time I dived in the Maltese Islands was at the end of July. That year, the water temperature was colder than usual, around 20\u00b0C. I wore a 5 mm full wetsuit with a hood, gloves and booties with a warm undersuit below, and I still felt a bit cold. Usually,in the summertime, water temperatures are 24 to 25\u00b0C.\nSeptember is the best time to go diving in Maltaif you want warm water and the best visibility while enjoying a shoulder season. Water has heated up all summer, and you can dive without the crowds and with lower accommodation prices.\nIs something still missing from this article?
