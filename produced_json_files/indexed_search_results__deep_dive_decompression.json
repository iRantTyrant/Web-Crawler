        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/best-diving-malta/",
        "content": "Malta might be the smallest country in the European Union, but the southern Mediterranean archipelago has earned the title of thescuba diving capital of Europe. And it was by building up its dive map since the 1970s. Besides clear blue waters all year, the Maltese islands offer one of Europe\u2019s largest densities of shipwrecks and scenic cavern systems. Until recently, I would have agreed with European divers saying you don\u2019t godiving in Maltafor its marine life. However, my last trip surprised me with incredible encounters. It even included one I had been expecting for ages.\nOn mysecond trip to Malta in 2016, I discovered what the archipelago had to offer underwater while doing my wreck diving specialty, with 5 dives in Malta and 3 in Gozo. This time, motivated to complete all the adventures I had missed, I moved to Malta for two months. It gave me the time to dive deeper into each island of the archipelago. I dedicate this blog post toonly my dives in Malta and Comino, and I will do a separate blog post about Gozo. Between the end of April and the beginning of May, I went diving around the island to photograph all the best recreational dive sites (within amaximum depth of 40 m). As a bonus, I also had the opportunity to go boat diving in Comino Island, whereas diving in Malta ismostly shore diving.\nDiving in Maltaat a glance\n\nThis time, I logged 7 dives around Malta and 2 in Comino Island. There are three main diving areas around the main island:\nAmong my top 5 diving spots in Malta, please note some locations are suitable for beginners, and others are for advanced divers due to depth. Malta is also a paradise for tech and even rebreather divers, with some shipwrecks well below 100 m deep. For information, these historical wrecks can only be visited with accredited dive centres. Through them, you pay a fee toHeritage Malta, the governmental organisation conserving them.\nHere is a video summary of my dives in Malta:\nMy dive parameters:\nThe 1969 Libyan tanker wreck is undoubtedly thequeen of shipwrecks in Malta, at least among the ones accessible to recreational divers. I already loved it the first time I dived there in 2016. This time I got to appreciate its finest details with 3 long dives: the stern, the bow, and the engine room.\nLike many famous shore dive sites in Malta, the divers who prepare their gear efficiently will get the best parking spot. Why does it matter, you may ask?Shore diving in Malta often involves going up and down stairs and rocks. With about 30 kg of scuba diving gear on your back, the early birds can save a few extra efforts. In Zurieq, on the south coast of Malta\u2019s main island, visitors flock daily to board one of the traditional \u201cluzzu\u201d boats to visit the Blue Grotto. The Scuba divers water entry point is at the same spot down steep stairs with a plundging view of Filfla Island, an unhabited nature reserve.\nEven if scuba diving instructors will do their best to assist, don\u2019t underestimate the fitness level you\u2019ll need to comfortably climb back those stairs after 1 hour of diving. Whoever says scuba diving isn\u2019t a sport never shore dived in Malta! Once down the stairs, there are about10 to 12 minutes of swimmingto reach the nearest part of the shipwreck. Due to the traffic of the boats going to the Blue Grotto, the swim is done between 5 and 10 m underwater. It\u2019s easier than battling waves at the surface fully equipped, but remember, you\u2019ll do it twice.\nFor the first dive, I focused on the closest part of the shipwreck but also the deepest: the stern and the propeller. As I went down to 35 m deep to take pictures of thegiant propeller on the white sandy bottom, it meant not enough non-deco bottom time to penetrate the rooms above the stern. Remember, you have a total 20-minute swim time, and at 36 m, you have a maximum of 11 minutes before hitting decompression. So, if you are spending a bit of time on pictures like me, better to slowly ascend along the hull and finish by going around the giant chimney at about 20 m.\nAt the end of every dive on the UM El Faroud, the exit procedure is to take a left turn from the stern to reach the wall of the shore. This way, you swim between 15 and 12 m for the first half and around 7 m towards the end. All this while looking for cool marine critters such asoctopus, cuttlefish, flying gurnards or moray eels. Once back in the cove for the safety stop, open your eyes between the ropes of the boats. This spring, we got an impressivemauve stinger bloom(jellyfish), but my favourite moment was when I finally got to see ajohn dory, a fish I\u2019ve been searching for more than 10 years!\nFor the second dive, I went all the way to the bow. There are at least 15 minutes of swimming, as you must go over the 110 m shipwreck.Halfway, you\u2019ll notice thesplit where the ship broke into two partsdue to a storm in Zurieq and not the initial explosion in 1995 in Valletta. At this point, exploring what is hiding inside the shipwreck is tempting. But because of the long swim and if you want to enjoy the view of the bow from the sandy bottom at 29 m, there is no time for this. The UM El Faroud is all about choices and clear objectives.\nI returned another day to finally explore the wreck\u2019s most fascinating rooms: thekitchen and the engine room. The first one is easily accessible at 26 m; it\u2019s the first door you\u2019ll see on the starboard of the stern. A (bit rusted) mixer by the side of the sink makes an amusing picture with a diver in the frame.\nMy favourite, though, was definitely the engine room. Make sure to follow your guide. The engine is at 31 m deep, and there is a bit of penetration down some stairs to get there. Another pointyou want to be sure of is to know how to properly frog-kick with your fins, or you might ruin the view for everyone else to see the impressive 12-cylinder engine. The jumble of pipes and valve wheels around it will delight the most demanding rust lovers.\nGiven the depths of the different points of the shipwreck, even the \u201cshallowest\u201d (25m), sorry, but this wreck dive is only for advanced scuba divers.\nMy dive parameters: max depth 36 m \u2013 dive time 46 min \u2013 water temperature 17\u00b0C\nI can barely believe I missed diving in Cirkewwa the first I went scuba diving in Malta. I loved it so much that the only reason the P29 shipwreck is coming second after the UM El Faroud is primarily due to the impressive size of the latter. The dive site environment of Cirkewwa, at thenorthwest tip of Malta Island, is beautiful, with a great variety of rock pools, walls, seagrass meadows, caverns, \u00a0sandy bottoms and many potential marine species encounters.\nThe P29 is a formerpatroller boat which used to belong to the army in Malta, but it originally belonged to the German Navy before being sold in 1997. She served until 2005, when the Malta Tourism Authority bought to make it an artificial reef. The shipwreck stands perfectly right on a sandy bottom at 36 m deep, so it\u2019s a fantastic recreational wreck dive for advanced divers.\nAn advantage Cirkewwa has over Zurieq is how much easier is the water entry:far fewer steps from the parking lot and about half the swimming distance. I was promised 5 minutes of swimming, but I feel it was more like 7 or 8 minutes. Since you can\u2019t see the shipwreck from the shore, carefully taking the correct bearings or following your guide is essential.\nBeing a relatively deep dive, I\u2019d recommend going directly at the bow, the furthest and deepest point (36 m). The ship is52 m long, so it takes about 3 minutes to swim from one end to the other. The view of the bow from the sandy bottom is incredibly photogenic. No wonder this is where I took the cover picture of this article! Then, you can explore the rest of the shipwreck level by level. Check the upper deck with its fake machine gun (made of car parts), then the cabin and finish with the mast. A bell has recently been added, so you can use it to celebrate any scuba milestone with your buddy or your instructor.\nBy diving in spring, besides Susie\u2019s Pool (the entry point) being filled withmauve stingers, I couldn\u2019t help but notice an impressive number of long white pouches hanging on different parts of the shipwreck. These weresquid eggs! Depending on the larvae\u2019s maturity, you might see the baby squids inside by shining a dive light at the egg.\nWatch your dive computer throughout this dive andanticipate how your non-deco time will drop or recoverto optimise your bottom time. As for the UM El Faroud, there is still the return swim to make.\nMy dive parameters: max depth 33 m \u2013 dive time 44 min \u2013 water temperature 17\u00b0C\nThis British tugboat from 1958 was scuttled in Cirkewwa in 1992. She is 40 m long, and like its neighbour, the P29 shipwreck, she is standing straight on the sandy bottom. While its engine and propeller were removed before the scuttling,its anchor, about 30 m away, made this shipwreck one of the most iconic in Malta, more than the ship itself sometimes (I have to say the bulky style of the bow doesn\u2019t help).\nI found manysquid eggsagain, especially on the anchor! Be careful about the additional swimming time to the anchor, another 2 to 3 minutes, considering that the anchor is still pretty deep, at 32 m. While swimming from the bow of the Rozi to the anchor, scan the sandy bottom because you might find some interesting marine critters. That\u2019s how I spotted asizable white monkfish! The joke goes that I was pretty sure I had seen a stargazer. The reason was mostly because I had never seen a white monkfish; they were pretty dark brown in Catalonia! Obviously, from 30 m, there is always the doubt of some level of narcosis messing with your fish ID skills. At least I had the picture on my camera to confirm.\nMy dive parameters: max depth 19 m \u2013 dive time 57 min \u2013 water temperature 18\u00b0C\nSince I wentboat diving in Cominofrom Malta, I thought it was fair to put it here. Beginners/Open Water divers will be pleased to hear that I\u2019m finally adding a dive site they can explore to this list. Not only the maximum depth of 18 m is easy to respect, but as you have to do it from a boat, there is no sporty approach or a long swim.Here everything is easy,including excellent visibility of 20-30 m (The P31 shipwreck is the neighbour of the famous Comino Blue Lagoon). So, if you\u2019ve never done wreck diving before, this is the place to gain more experience.\nNow, does it mean it\u2019s a boring dive for experienced divers? Quite far from it! Thanks to its shallower depths and no swim time, you can spendan entire hour exploring all the details of the twin ship of the P29without worrying about your non-deco time or your air consumption. In my case, I took the opportunity of this long relaxing dive to bring my macro lens and spent a third of the dive on close-up shots of the pilgrim hervias and pink flabellinas roaming along the shipwreck hull.\nMy dive parameters: max depth 20 m \u2013 dive time 66 min \u2013 water temperature 17\u00b0C\nI am the first surprised that thistraining shipwreck in the urban area of Sliema, next to Malta\u2019s capital city, Valletta, made it to my top 5 dive sites list. But as I compared my pictures and notes, I couldn\u2019t reach another conclusion: This is a great dive site!\nDirectly accessible from the rocky beach of Sliema,next to Dive Systems Malta dive centre, the shipwreck is on the outskirt of Exile Bay. There is a fair bit of swimming, about 12 minutes. Still, it\u2019s such a beautiful and peaceful reef with a Posidonia seagrass meadow where Mediterranean damselfish swirl all around, and apparently, many octopus hide (well, apparently, extremely well).\nBecause it\u2019s an easy dive, it is often used for scuba diving courses. Indeed, I did one of my wreck specialty dives there in 2016, and I used it again this year as a check dive with my buddy who had never dived in Malta before. With a maximum depth of 18 m, it\u2019s aperfect dive site for beginnersand Open Water divers.\nOnce you arrive at the end of Exile Reef, where it takes a right turn, you should see the shape of the wreck appears. The shipwreck is not that big, 30 m long, so it only takes 2 minutes to go from the bow to the stern. So, with a pretty shallow depth, you have enough time to go 3 times around it. The most important is to remember toreturn to the reef at half tankbecause of the long swim.\nThe first time I dived this shipwreck, it had been recently scuttled, so the hull was pretty clean. 7 years later, the seaweed covers it, but if you know where to look, you can still see abeautiful Maltese cross embossedbelow the cabin on the stern side. This is a great dive for underwater photographers to adjust their settings at the beginning of any dive trip in Malta.\nNow you know my five favourite spots, I wanted to give you more information about the other dive sites I had the opportunity to explore and liked. I couldn\u2019t do two famous dive sites of Malta, two famous plane wrecks, the Blenheim Bomber and the Beaufighter. These two require booking a boat dive, and as these are not as often requested as the shore dive sites, I didn\u2019t have the chance to go. A reason to come back to Malta one more time?\nThe only WWII shipwreck accessible to recreational divers in Malta. The former British destroyer is so shallow that even beginner divers can explore it down the fortified walls of Valletta facing Sliema (it initially sank on this other side and was towed there). It was the final dive of my wreck diving specialty, but unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t much left of the ship. I think the most exciting was diving right next to the capital city of Malta.\nWas it because of the waves or because of a boat propeller? Anyway, 2 or the 3 caves located on the north shore of Comino had a milky water with a high density of white sand in suspension. Exploring them was impossible since the two first caves communicate with an underwater arch. The last one was clear, but there wasn\u2019t much to see except for a few nudibranchs and fan worms. I think my favourite part was navigating along the dramatic cliffs of Comino. It\u2019s a great dive for beginner divers who have never experienced cavern diving. Experienced divers won\u2019t be much impressed.\nThe dive site is 5-10 minutes driving a bit further away down the south coast after the Blue Grotto, in Siggiewi, near the Xaqqa Cliffs. A bit of a slope to access the pretty entrance pool. As we penetrated the cavern system, I was first excited by the tight entrance and beautiful rays of sunshine (note there was always an easy exit to the surface at any point). But in like 5 minutes, we were outside. I thought, \u201cThere must be another part\u201d; no, that was it. We finished the dive above seagrass meadows, where we saw nothing special.\nMalta is the southmost island of Europe between Sicily and Tunisia. ItsMediterranean marine lifeis representative of what can be seen in Spain, France and Italy, and not like Greece or Turkey, like one might think. However, no underwater forest of red and yellow gorgonians or large groupers in Malta but a wealth of shipwrecks and caverns. This being said, a john dory, a splendid fish I had been looking for everywhere from Scotland to Spain finally showed up at the safety stop of my final dive at the UM El Faroud; for sure, one of my most memorable underwater encounters.\nI summed up below the mostcommon fish speciesI saw in the waters of Malta, from the most common to the one-time encounters. I included those I saw in Comino and Gozo, as you will likely see them all around the archipelago.\nFrom anudibranchpoint of view, Malta is a surprising paradise for underwater macro photographers. They seem to love both caverns and shipwrecks. Spots the seaweeds and hydroids moving with the currents, and you\u2019ll find them.\nOthernotable marine specieswhile diving in the Maltese islands:\nImportant note about the fireworms: they\u2019re pretty with their bright orange colours (cf. top picture of this section), but make sure you never touch those! Their name is the warning. Their sting doesn\u2019t hurt, it burns! There is an incredible amount of them on every dive site. Besides, these little sneaky b******s tend to fall from walls or shipwrecks on your hands or neck, so always carefully approach any surface underwater.\nIt took me 3 trips to Malta, but I got it right this time! I now have the perfect place to stay in Malta, and on top of this,one of the best dive centres on the islandwas just down the road from where I stayed: I\u2019m talking about Sliema.\nIn only 10 minutes, I could walk toDive Systems Maltaat the end of Exile Bay. Their dive centre includes a large dive shop (if you need to buy or replace any piece of gear, they have everything) on the top floor with a classroom for people in training. The floor below is the locker room, with all the rental gear and compressor room. For people like me coming with their own scuba gear, there is plenty of space to store all your equipment for the time of your stay.Each diver is assigned a box with a numberand a rack for the wetsuit with the same number. So, plenty of room to change, lockers to keep your valuables safe and warm showers, what else to ask?\nAs most of the diving is shore diving in Malta, we usually prepared our boxes at the meet-up time, generally 8.30 am. Then everyone with their instructors loaded the tanks and the equipment boxes on one of the trucks or vans of the dive centre.Every day you might visit a different corner of the island for the price of your dive. If you\u2019re going boat diving to Comino, you\u2019ll join their sister dive centre,Starfish diving, in St Julians which has its own quay.\nNote to all tech divers that Dive Systems Maltacaters to advanced gas mixes, DPV and CCR divingand is one of the approved dive centres to explore the deep historical shipwrecks around the island. Their boat is licensed with Heritage Malta.\nYes, it is! If you consider passing your Open Water certification to become a scuba diver, go for it. Thanks to a great choice ofaccessible shore diving sitesand the range of depth available, it is less stressful to learn basic skills.\nThe best locations for beginners are located inSliema (Tugboat II) and Marsaskala (Tugboat 10, St Michael tugboats). These dive sites are shallow enough for beginners. The advantage of shore diving is that you won\u2019t risk seasickness, have more space to prepare your gear, and can remain as shallow as you feel comfortable. Note some shore dive sites in Malta sometimes require a sporty approach, on land or swimming, but this is not the case for the dive sites above.\nFor Open Water divers looking toexpand their dive skills, Malta is a great place to experience deep diving, wreck diving or cavern diving. I did this on my first dive trip there; I passed my wreck diving specialty.\nThe scuba diving season in Malta is usuallyfrom March to November, but several dive centres remain open all year long. With anaverage water temperature of 20\u00b0C, you can dive in Malta in a wetsuit anytime. Even in the winter, with stronger winds, thanks to its numerous shore dive sites around the island,scuba divers can find a sheltered spot every day.\nThis time, I scuba dived inspring when the water is nearly at its coldest. From the end of April to the second half of May, I saw the temperature increase by almost 1\u00b0C every week. Sometimes, the wind could bring back colder water, but I went from16\u00b0C to 19\u00b0Cin 3 weeks. Bringing a semi-dry suit was an excellent choice for this level of temperatures.\nThe first time I dived in Malta was at the end of July. That year water temperature was colder than usual, with a temperature around 20\u00b0C. I wore a 5 mm full wetsuit with a hood, gloves and booties with a warm undersuit below, and I still felt a bit cold. Usually,in the summertime, water temperatures are 24 to 25\u00b0C.\nIf you are looking for the warmest water and the best visibility while enjoying a shoulder season, thenSeptember is the best time to dive in Malta. Water has heated up all summer with amaximum water temperature around 26\u00b0C, and you can dive without the crowds and with lower accommodation prices.\nOnce you\u2019re in Europe, getting to Malta couldn\u2019t be easier. There aredirect flights from virtually every main city in Europe. I flew from Paris and flew back to Marseille! Plenty of options from the UK, with flights from all London airports, but also Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and many more. You\u2019ll find something similar for Germany, Spain, Italy, and many other European countries. To find at which dates you can find thebest prices on flights, you can easily compare prices ontrip.com.\nIf you don\u2019t feel like flying, there is a possibility of going there byferry from Palermo or Pozzallo in Sicily, Italy. To get there, note there is anight train going from Rome to Palermo, Sicily(including an incredible cross-over of the Messina Strait of the train on a ferry, yes, you read correctly). As you can see, I looked into the details, but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t make it this time.\nNo hesitation this time, stay away from Saint Paul\u2019s Bay andstay in Sliema. It\u2019s central, next to Valletta, with plenty of yummy and reasonably priced restaurants, direct access to a lovely long seafront promenade, and all the best dive centres are a short walk away. Since I was working remotely in Malta for an extended period of time, I rented an apartment for a month. However, for 2 nights before and after, I tried two different types of accommodation: a hostel and a luxury resort. This way, you can pick what fits your budget!\nAll adventurers deserve a treat! After a 2-week marathon of conferences and an intense week of wreck diving, when I gave back the keys of my flat in Sliema,I couldn\u2019t dream of a better place to staythan theAX Palace in the heart of Sliema. If you can, pay the extra to get a room on the upper floors becausethe views of Valletta from the balcony are incredible at sunrise and sunset. My room was incredibly tastefully decorated, and the bed was a dream.\nTheoutdoor rooftop poolwas the perfect spot for a refreshing swim and a cocktail. In the evening, the indoor pool, with its sauna and hammam, was the cherry on top of my relaxing stopover before moving to Gozo. While I wasn\u2019t too impressed with the breakfast, book a table one night at their Asian restaurant on the rooftop next to the pool. Whether you like eating Thai, Indian, Japanese, or a mix of everything, they have it all, and it tastes as it should, and the service is top-notch. Top tip, when booking the table, ask for a table near the windows with views of Valletta.\nWaiting for my flat to be available, I booked 2 nights in ahostel in St Julian\u2019s near Sliema. I thought it was the best way to start my stay in Malta as hostels are usually fantastic places to meet with other travellers and gather valuable tips.\nAnd this is precisely how it went atMalti hostel. I must admit, I picked this one because they also offered private rooms at a great price (40\u20ac a night in April), it was close to Balluta Bay, and they have a jacuzzi on their rooftop. Well, I discovered later the water of the jacuzzi was pretty cold, and in the chilly temperatures of April, I couldn\u2019t stay longer than 5 min! Anyway, I love thecosy living room and kitchen that worked perfectly to socialise with the other guests, even if my room was in another building, but literally next door.\nIs something still missing from this article? Do you have any questions?\nPlease let me know in the comments, and I\u2019ll do my best to help!\nThis article was written in partnership withMalta Tourism Authority. As always, all my views and opinions are my own and reflect my experience honestly.\nPIN IT FOR LATER",

        "title": "Diving in Menjangan Island: a remote coral wonderland in Bali",
        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/diving-menjangan-bali/",
        "content": "Nestled off its northwestern coast, Menjangan remainsone of Bali\u2019s most underrated dive destinations. Often overshadowed by more popular and more easily accessible diving spots such as Tulamben or Nusa Penida, Menjangan offers a tranquil escape with turquoise waters and vibrant coral gardens. Any underwater adventurer should make the effort to drive a little further and put the tiny island on the itinerary when goingdiving in Bali. Besides, Menjangan is part of the West Bali National Park,Indonesia\u2019s oldest national park: its reefs have been protected for over a century. The extended travel time and the historical protection have made Menjangan a fabulous place for marine biodiversity enthusiasts who love having the spot almost to themselves.\nI had the opportunity to explore Menjangan both underwater and on land in 2015 and again in late 2023. Each of my visits offered complementary perspectives on the island\u2019s beauty and natural diversity. Menjangan ranks amongBali\u2019s best dive sites,boasting colourful giant gorgonians, pygmy seahorses and clownfish. The island\u2019s calm waters and shallow reefs provide ideal conditions for beginners, while its deeper walls are all aboutdrift divingfor advanced divers.\nMenjangan Island also features an intriguing terrestrial aspect. Its name in Indonesian means \u201cisland of the deer\u201c; indeed, its namesake deer can be spotted sunbathing on its beaches or grazing on its cliffs. This unique blend of natural wonders above and below the sea underscores why Menjangan should not be overlooked when planning a dive trip to Bali.\nDivingin Menjangan Islandat a glance\n\n\nEstablished in 1917 andofficially designated as a national park by the Indonesian government in 1941,West Bali National Park(Bali Barat) encompasses approximately 190 km\u00b2, representing about 5% of Bali\u2019s total land area. It remains to this day, the only national park in Bali. It starts after Pemuteran and stops before Gilimanuk (where you can take the ferry to Java). Beyond its protection status, a distinct advantage of Menjangan Island is its distance and travel time from the crowded south of Bali. Hence, it remainsprotected from mass tourism.\nBali Barat National Park serves as a sanctuary for a broad array of wildlife, both marine and on land; it is also a popular spot for bird watchers in Bali. Menjangan Island, though just a tiny part of this extensive park, plays a pivotal role in the region\u2019s conservation efforts. The park\u2019s early establishment at the beginning of the 20thcentury has helpedsafeguard the island\u2019s coral reefs from the damage seen in other parts of Indonesia(ever heard of dynamite fishing orblast fishing?).\nThe waters surrounding the island are renowned for their crystal-clear visibility, often extending up to 50 meters in the dry season, allowing divers an exceptional view of the reefs below. This protected underwater ecosystem, whereover 110 identified coral speciesthrive, is arguably one of the best-preserved reef environments in Indonesia. Menjangan Island is a must-visit for those diving in Bali and an example of successful conservation practices in a world that desperately needs more of these sanctuaries.\nTheentrance ticket to the National Park\u00a0is 200,000 Rp(12\u20ac) since July 2014. The price hasn\u2019t changed since my first visit, but they introduced a higher fare on weekends and national holidays for foreigners, 300,000 Rp (17\u20ac). Scuba divers don\u2019t have to take care of paying the entrance fee, it\u2019s generally included in the price of their dives by the dive centre.\nMenjangan Island caters to all scuba diving levels, from beginners to advanced divers trained to descend to a depth of 40 m.The calm, sheltered waters around the island make it an ideal spot for Open Water divers and even enthusiast snorkelers, while the deep walls and thrilling drift dives attract experienced divers. Menjangan\u2019s dive sites are adaptable to different skill levels, as it is easy to limit the maximum depth while maintaining an interesting route with plenty of corals and marine wildlife to see. However, some dive sites may be more exposed to currents, but your divemasters will carefully pick suitable sites for the divers on board each day.\nThe island might only be 39km\u00b2, but it is surrounded by11 dive sitesthat are all more interesting than each other. You can drift dive, wall dive, deep dive, and if you are into underwater photography, you will just want more! Here are the 3 dive sites I  explored in 2015 and 2023:\nEach time, I went down at amaximum depth of 25 m(there is not really much to see below) and enjoyed leisurely drift dives for60 to 70 minutes. The boat picks you up at the end of the dive: there is no need to battle against the current as you glide effortlessly, adjusting the position of your body to the current to control your speed and give you enough time to see all the critters.\nEach dive usually starts by following a wall, going and reaching the deepest point agreed upon at the briefing.Between giant gorgonians and barrel sponges, you will likely cross paths with batfish, crocodilefish and frogfish. Getting closer to the gorgonians, I could see a denise pygmy seahorse and various nudibranchs. Then, we follow up a sandy slope inhabited by the garden and sand moray eels. In the shallows, the hard corals and sea anemones are full of marine life, especially clownfish and anemone shrimps.\nDive sites like Pos II, Coral Garden, and Eel Garden are renowned for theirmarine biodiversity. The island\u2019s underwater topography and gentle currents allow divers to combine a variety of dive environments in a single visit, such as deep walls, sandy slopes and coral gardens. My favourite encounter in Menjangan Island? The Denise pygmy seahorse, which I saw for the first time in nearly 15 years of diving.\nI summed up below thefish speciesI saw in the waters of Menjangan, from the most common to the one-time encounters:\nMenjangan, like many dive sites in Bali, is aparadise for underwater macro photographers. You\u2019ll likely find nudibranchs and pygmy seahorses by looking closely at gorgonians, sea anemones and sponges. Here are the species I saw in Menjangan, from the most common to the one-time encounters:\nMenjangan Island extends beyond its underwater treasures. During surface intervals, divers can explore the island, including the surroundings of aBalinese temple(the sanctuary is not open to visitors other than Balinese people coming to pray) and awhite sand beachnear the national park office with aview of East Java\u2019s volcanoes, especially Mount Ijen. The latter is where we had a picnic on my first visit to Menjangan Island. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen sand any whiter around Bali.\nThe island\u2019s south side near the temple is thebest place to spot the island\u2019s namesake deergrazing in the underbrush. This side of the island is mostly made of cliffs, so it offers quite the vantage point on Bali\u2019s northern shore. I noticed some deer coming to the jetty looking for freshwater as the island is rather dry, but please refrain from giving them food.\nBeyond the beauty of its landscape, it\u2019s impossible not to be struck by the intricately carvedwhite Ganesh templehanging above turquoise waters. The island also has a religious significance. Scuba divers and nature lovers are not the only ones showing up at the transfer jetty in Pelabuhan Lalang. Balinese people in traditional attire visit the island most days, bringing offerings and participating incultural rituals highlighting this sanctuary\u2019s spiritual importance. However, despite the numerous signs both in Indonesian and English prohibiting single-use plastics, we can only regret seeing these offerings are often packed in plastic bags that remain on the island.\nExploring Pemuteran\u2019s dive sites after visiting Menjangan Island offers a different diving experience that can be a valuable addition to your itinerary. However, Pemuteran Bay, known for itsmuck divingspots, contrasts sharply with the pristine conditions found in Menjangan. During my recent visit, I engaged in night diving at the Macro Jetty, explored the Biorock project in Pemuteran Bay, an initiative aimed at coral restoration, and tried diving Pemuteran outer reef at Pulaki Reef.\nTheBiorock project, in particular, shows successful colonization by diverse marine life, including batfish and sea turtles playing hide-and-seek among the structures inspired by the Balinese culture. On the other hand, I have to be honest: My favourite part of diving the outer reef of Pemuteran was the boat ride with the view of Bali\u2019s mountainous northern coastline.\nThenight dive at the Macro Jettyoffered a stark introduction to muck diving in Indonesia, reminiscent of the famous but heavily polluted Lembeh Strait in Northern Sulawesi. Despite the waste and debris, the dive revealed fascinating marine life, such as a juvenile coconut octopus, a light pink thorny seahorse, and arare butterfly nudibranch(Cierce Elegans) so transparent I didn\u2019t know where to set the focus of my camera!\nI summed up below everything you need to know to prepare for your trip to go diving in Menjangan Island: best season, water temperatures, best dive centre and the best places to stay.\nReaching Menjangan Island typically starts from Pemuteran, the closest hub with a range of dive centres, restaurants and hotels. Due to Menjangan\u2019s remote location, it\u2019s recommended that diverstravel to Pemuteran a day beforetheir dive to relax and start early the following morning.\nThe first time, I travelled to Pemuteran from Ubud, I took thescenic road through Bedugul, a highland area known for its cool climate and delicious strawberries. This route offers a refreshing stop and is the most direct route to the North of Bali. It took about four hours, including a short visit toPura Ulun Danu(which might be Bali\u2019s most famous postcard). Divers should note that this road should not be taken immediately after diving to prevent decompression sickness. Bedugul is at 1,500 m of altitude.\nOn my most recent trip, as I\u2019m based in Amed, I travelled to Pemuteran via thenorthern coastal road that passes through Singarajain 4 hours. Right after,Lovina Beachprovides a delightful break for lunch. The journey between Tianyar and Kubutambahan is particularly pleasant, with some nice views of the ocean. This alternative route is suitable for those planning to drive right after diving, avoiding high-altitude roads.\nOnce in Pemuteran, accessing Menjangan Island is straightforward. Dive trips usually begin early in the morning with a 30-minute drive toLabuhan Lalang Jetty, where the dive operators handle all park and boat fees. From there, it\u2019s a15- to 20-minute boat rideto Menjangan Island\u2019s first dive sites.\nTo get a complete diving experience in Bali and make the most of your time, anideal itinerary including Menjangan Islandwould start in Ubud upon arrival, then move to Pemuteran via the scenic Bedugul route, continuing to Amed or Tulamben for more diving adventures, and possibly concluding with a visit to Nusa Lembongan or Penida, accessible by ferry from Padang Bai. It is then possible to reach Sanur by speedboat, which is the closest to the airport.\nThe optimal months for diving at Menjangan arefrom May to October, during Bali\u2019s dry season when underwater conditions are at their best. However, the protective status of the national park means that Menjangan Island offers good diving conditions nearly all year round, with slightly varying visibility but remains always decent.\nThe first timeI went diving in Menjagan,it was in October and the visibility was fantastic. It was a little less true, especially in the deeper areas along the walls, when I returned diving there in late December. In both case, I always had warm water temperature with29\u00b0C on average.\nPemuteran, the closest access point to Menjangan, hosts severalreputable dive centres, withDive Concepts Pemuteranbeing a solid choice. They are conveniently located within the same building as Hotel Arjuna, enhancing the ease of your stay. The proximity to comfortable accommodations allows divers to relax fully before and after their expeditions. Their all-inclusive packages typically cover accommodation, breakfast, transfer by van to Labuhan Lalang Jetty, boat ride to Menjangan Island, lunch and diving and rental equipment.\nFor those planning a trip to Menjangan Island, staying overnight in Pemuteran and considering a local operator like Dive Concepts is much better than booking with an operator from the south of Bali with a pick-up time of around 5 am.Staying at least one night in Pemuteran makes the trip less rushed and tends to be more cost-effective. This approach avoids the complications of long-distance travel and potential decompression issues associated with driving at higher altitudes right after diving.\nPemuteran, the nearest village to Menjangan, offers a range of lodging options, from budget homestays to luxurious resorts, making it an ideal base for divers.The charm and tranquillity of Pemuteran haven\u2019t changed over the years, except for a few additional yummy eateries along the main road (I recommendthe Sagefor a tasty and healthy dinner).\nArjuna Homestayis one of the best options for astylish retreat at the best price for scuba divers. Located alongside Dive Concepts, it offers divers double, twin and family rooms with tasteful decor and a long swimming pool in the shade of frangipani trees. Having tested both the ground-floor rooms with direct access to the pool and the first-floor rooms, I preferred the latter since the view from the balcony is incredible. And let\u2019s give a special mention to the delicious breakfast buffet (best crepes I have eaten in Bali) served on their rooftop terrace with incredible views of the mountain backdrop.\nIf you\u2019re looking to splurge on your nature getaway, there is a luxury resort right in the West Bali National Park, theNusa Bay Menjangan. It is not for all budgets, but the experience looks amazing.\nDo you need more information to plan a dive trip to Bali?\nCheck these additional articles about travelling and scuba diving in Bali:\nPIN IT FOR LATER\n\nI\u2019m not really comfortable in the water and around fish, but I do realize I miss out on a lot! It must be absolutely great to discover a whole new underwater world! I think I would stick with the scenic route in the North, but maybe it\u2019s about time to overcome my fears\u2026\nReply\nEven if you don\u2019t dive, Menjangan and Pemuteran surroundings are fantastic and are worth the trip! And if one day you feel like trying then you might consider Menjangan, it\u2019s a perfect place to try, even if it\u2019s only snorkeling \ud83d\ude42\nReply\nWow, thanks for sharing all this great info! I definitely hope to scuba dive there one day!\nReply\nThank you! I hope you will be able to go there, don\u2019t hesitate to spend at least 3 days in Pemuteran, there is so much to see all around!\nReply\nGreat pictures, post and tips!!

        "title": "Where is the best diving in Bocas del Toro, Panama?",
        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/diving-bocas-del-toro/",
        "content": "I decided to end my three months in Panama by spending a month in theCaribbean Archipelago of Bocas del Toro. It gave me enough time to dive, snorkel, mountain bike, kayak and hike across it, from Boca del Drago to Cayos Zapatilla. Bocas del Toro is home to theBastimentos Marine National Park, Panama\u2019s first marine park, created in 1988 and covering an area of 230 km\u00b2 near the border with Costa Rica. It extends from the island of Bastimentos to the Zapatilla Cays and covers approximately 50% of the archipelago. With one national park, 9 main islands, 50 cays and more than 200 islets, it\u2019s only natural to wonder where to go scuba diving in the archipelago.\nBefore diving in Panama, I often heard people praisingdiving in Coiba(rightfully) and having mixed feelings about diving in Bocas del Toro. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why. I had the opportunity to dive in the Caribbean coast during my stay inPanama City, in Portobello, and I loved what I saw. Besides, one cannot compare the environments of the Pacific Ocean with the Caribbean Sea: these are entirely different ecosystems.\nMy first guess was that people might be more easily impressed by the sharks of Coiba. Macro critters and otherfunny-looking sea creaturesbeloved by marine biology nerds might require more experience to appreciate fully. My second guess came when I started looking at the map more closely: I realised that some people didn\u2019t know there was a marine national park in Bocas del Toro! I studied the national park boundaries and where most dive sites were. So here is my story of trying to understand the geography of Bocas del Toro\u2019s reefs, thelogistics of diving thereand, of course, whether it is worth the trip (spoiler alert: yes!).\nDiving in Bocas del Toroat a glance\n\nI went scuba diving right at the beginning of my stay in Bocas del Toro since I stayed a couple of nights at thePalma Royale hotelon thesouthernmost tip of Bocas Townbefore moving to anapartment further north. The main dive centres are all in this area so that you can board your diving boat only 5 minutes after breakfast. The journey from Santa Catalina near Coiba National Parl took me more than 12 hours, including a boat arrival on Colon Island by moonlight. I couldn\u2019t dream of a better set-up to start my Bocas del Toro adventure while making things easy to rest a bit.\nMaking a list of the best dive sites in Bocas del Toro isn\u2019t easy. On the one hand, there is this marine playground which is so vast, and on the other hand, the area where most scuba diving boats go is quite limited (between Colon and Solarte Islands), but a few further sites. These are only accessible when the conditions of currents and swell are favourable, typically during the peak season of September/October, and I visited Bocas del Toro in March/April. But so you know, I heard many good things about the two dive sites:Sachen and Tiger Rock.\nFinally,the area between Bastimentos Island and Zapatilla Cays is seldom scuba dived. A few resorts might offer it, but they don\u2019t have scuba diving gear and a compressor: everything comes from Bocas Town, including the dive guides! So to make the logistics cost worthy, it means having enough people to join. I thought we almost had this, but unfortunately, the couple I was supposed to join cancelled.\nHence here are the 5 dive sites I visited from Bocas Town with Bocas Dive Center, scuba diving tank included (keep reading, you\u2019ll understand why I\u2019m saying this). Thanks to their limited depth, these dive sites aresuitable for beginner divers. Besides, I never had any current on any of these dives. Bocas del Toro is great spot to get certified.\nThis is usually the instructors\u2019 and divemasters\u2019 favourite dive site because its atmosphere makes themthink about the movie Avatar(hence the name of the dive site). The dive follows a coral and sponge reef with a gentle slope. It is possible to go deeper, but you won\u2019t find anything other than sand. Among the colourful sponges, I found typical Caribbean marine critters such as spotted drums, spiny lobsters, squirrelfish and grey angelfish.\nThe second part of the dive leads to an unexpected sailboat wreck. TheGodewind sailboatwas sunk near the island of Solarte in 2019 for the greatest pleasure of scuba divers in Bocas del Toro: sailboat wrecks are uncommon. This artificial wreck offers incredible views and photo opportunities with its sail still standing, slowly getting covered in sponges. Stay close to your guide; they might show you too the nurse sharks sleeping inside. With a maximum depth of 18 m, even beginner divers can join.\nA beautiful coral and sponge reef with many butterflyfish and feather worms near Solarte Island, where I found a fewinfamous invasive lionfish. But thankfully, not so many! Bocas del Toro actively hunts them, and even a butcher in town (yes!) is selling the lionfish filets.\nThe highlight of the dive site is the artificial shipwreck (yes, another one!) of a trimaran. TheMystic Wind wreckis covered in sponges and giant oysters. We were looking for rays and sharks, but I was still happy only finding yellow schoolmaster snappers hiding inside the cabin.\nIn 2006, a BAe Jetstream of Air Panama couldn\u2019t stop after landing at Bocas del Toro airport due to heavy rainfall. It overran the strip to crash into bushes. There was no casualty, but the plane was beyond repair. This is how it became this surprisingplane wreck dive siteright in front of Bocas Dive Center pier after a few years of sitting near the airport.\nSo, imagine people doing their DSD and how exciting it must be; even experienced divers like me can enjoy a long dive with endless underwater photo opportunities around the plane wreck and below the pier. Between the butterfly fish, the surgeonfish, the angelfish, including many juvenile individuals, the feather worms, the swirling schools of sardines, the trumpetfish and the arrowhead spider crabs, you won\u2019t get bored. The most surprising species of all? Theupside-down jellyfish! So don\u2019t look down at this 5 m deep dive site; make sure to have time for it.\nMyfavourite of all my dives in Bocas del Torois where I found the reef to be the most interesting in shapes and colours while being full of life. The site is mostly flat at the same depth, with a mix of coral reefs, sponges and sandy bottom. Yellow, purple, red, green, orange: the array of colours from the different sponge species in the shape of barrels, tubes or candelabras was staggering.\nWe found severaltoadfish hiding in their rocky den. I\u2019m glad I could count on the eagle eyes of Bocas Dive Center instructors and their expert knowledge of the reef. They might not be as colourful as their Cozumel cousin (splendid toadfish), but they are still an interesting marine critter you won\u2019t see everywhere. The other remarkable species I spotted included butterfly fish, porcupine pufferfish, barracudas and spotted moray eels.\nFor my final dive with Bocas Dive Center, I had a couple of grey angelfish that decided to stick with me at the beginning. They obviously liked to pose for my pictures. Loro Verde reef had many sponge formations but in different shapes than the other sites. But the most surprising was theimpressive number of star brittlescovering most of them. With a little distance, it looked like the sponges were moving.\nI had the pleasure of spotting another toadfish, butmy favourite moment was my encounter with a squad of squids. Spring is the peak season to see them. It was so funny to see how they were both shy and curious. They gave me long minutes to take pictures and videos. The cherry on top was a beautiful stingray swimming by our group right before we ascended to our safety stop.\nAfter scuba diving south of Colon Island, I took a small bus to its northernmost tip:Boca del Drago. It leaves from the main square (Simon Bolivar Park), and the ride costs only 3,50$. It takes about 50 minutes to arrive at the terminus, the famous restaurant Yanis Nori. They\u2019re a local family business and have been serving the best Panamanian seafood recipes with a Caribbean touch since 1989 (if you are only eating lobster once in Bocas del Toro, this is where to have it for 25$).\nOnce in Boca del Drago, it is a 15-minute walk through the mangrove and along the sea until Playa Estrella. Don\u2019t rush because the trail is beautiful, and you can spot cappuccino monkeys and three-toed sloths if you pay attention. The kind gentleman renting masks and snorkels helped mespot my first three-toed sloth. Indeed, I knew the space on the bus would be extremely limited, so I left most of my clothes and all my dive gear behind in Bocas Town. The rental wasn\u2019t expensive (2$), but I regretted not taking at least my mask and snorkel. The mask kept flooding.\nIf many people flock to Playa Estrella (Star Beach), it\u2019s because it\u2019s the home of acolony of photogenic red cushion starfish. Most tourists book a boat tour from Bocas Town, which stops at Playa Estrella (35-40$), but I wasn\u2019t the only one coming by bus either (the bus was usually packed). Unfortunately, despite some level of awareness that the starfish need to be protected (many signs invite tourists not to touch or move them), the loud music of some of the beach restaurants is pushing the starfish away.\nYou might only be able to see them byfreediving to 2 to 5 m deep. I did this; it took me less than 5 minutes to find the first starfish. I spent about 15 minutes in the water taking a few pictures, and that was about it since there was nothing else than sand beside the starfish. Walking further down the beach in a quitter spot allowed me for a great picture in only 30 cm of water.\nSpecial tip: Sleep at Yanis Nori\u2019s guesthouse for at least one night to be the first on-site in the morning. In my case, I stayed for two nights and was invited by the owner\u2019s daughter on amountain bike ride through the jungletowards the east coast of Colon island. On the way, we spotted cappuccino monkeys, howler monkeys and a tiny green-golden dart frog. I used all my forces that day, but I made a new friend that day!\nThis is where things got a little trickier when I tried to go scuba diving inBastimentos Marine National Park. Unfortunately, all the scuba diving resources, which means tanks, compressors, and divemasters, remain in Bocas Town. It means that the resorts on Bastimentos Island, even those advertising scuba diving,bring people and gear from Bocas Town based on demand. You can also directly go diving from Bocas town with a longer boat ride as a day trip. In both cases, it\u2019s a matter of how many people will request it to make it economically viable. I was close to making it, but the couple I was supposed to dive with cancelled at the last minute.\nThe owners of Tranquilo Bay, the dream eco-resort I stayed at on Bastimentos Island, cheered me up, saying they would book me on activities with great snorkelling/free diving and thatI would likely be surprised. I always wanted to improve my skills at taking underwater pictures with a single breath, so here was my opportunity (by necessity)!\nMy first day trip was to the jewels of the Bastimentos National Park:Cayos Zapatilla. Tranquilo Bay is ideally located just in front of them, so it only takes about 20 minutes to get there from their pier. Zapatilla 1 is fully protected and can\u2019t be visited. Zapatilla 2 is dedicated to ecotourism, with marked trails and wood pathways to explore it without damaging anything. I loved spotting great kiskadee birds, freshwater turtles and basilic lizards in its swamp area.\nExploring Zapatilla 2 reefs was still the best part of my day. For safety reasons, the boat captain came with me. We used a kayak to approach the coral reefs of Zapatilla cay #2 in slightly deeper water. From there, I could snorkel and free dive in a beautiful coral reef with no one around. Breath after breath, I found many treasures under the waves: astingraycame to say hi and took me to a sea fan garden on a sandy bottom, I found a crack where thelobsterparty was, I caught a couple ofFrench angelfishon a love parade, and at the end, anurse sharkcame to say bye (but it was too quick for me to take a picture).\nI was never deeper than 5 m, so it helped to have enough time to take pictures. But to be honest, without weights, even if I was only wearing my UV-protected rashguard and leggings, it wasn\u2019t easy to stay long. I spent about 2 hours in the water and never got bored.Kayaking + Snorkellingin the heart of a Caribbean national park? Approved!\nTranquilo Bay is a lodge on Bastimentos Island for all nature lovers, especially birders. As a diver, I was a little bit of an outsider but felt very welcome by their team of naturalist guides. They taught me everything I know today about bird watching, and I returned the favour by leading a night snorkelling session atTranquilo Bay\u2019s own mangrove reefthat no other guest ever asked for.\nI did a first session by day to get my bearings underwater. The part near the mangrove was shallow, maybe a meter of water, but from the pier, there is a slope goingdown to 10 mquickly. The corals near the mangrove were mainly unknown to me, but I did recognise the fire coral that you do not want to touch by any means.\nMy favourite discovery was thelettuce sea slug(Elysia Crispata), whose intricate ruffles come in many shades: blue, pink, purple and green! I had never seen these before: these mangrove coral reefs are staggering. These nudibranchs were in relatively shallow water and often fed on seagrass. Taking a good shot of them wasn\u2019t always easy as they swung along the current. I was just mesmerised by them, and they were another reason to make me regret not taking my macro lens during my year in Latin America.\nAt night, it was like a crab and squid party. Many arrowhead spider crabs came out, but also a new species to me: thechannel clinging crab, also called the Caribbean king crab. But my favourite moment was when we met once again a squad of squids: by night, with a pitch black background, right below the surface, my pictures look like the squid are swimming below a mirror.\nI summed up below everything you need to know to prepare for your trip to go diving in Bocas del Toro: the best season, water temperatures, dive centre and places to stay.\nAnother tricky point about Bocas del Toro is the best diving season. While Panama\u2019s summer (dry) season is from December to April, thebest diving season in Bocas del Toro is in September-October, Bocas\u2019 mini-dry season. I was diving in Bocas del Toro between March and April, and most days were sunny, but we had one weekend with pouring rain, which created floods all over the archipelago.\nThe water is always warm,around 28\u00b0C, so technically, you can dive all year long. I used my wetsuit initially, but it was useless; I ended up diving with only my rashguard and leggings. What you need to take into account in Bocas are the currents. They tend to calm down in September-October, making some of the best dive sites (Sachen, Tiger Rock) on the northern side of the archipelago only accessible at that time.\nBut not all is lost when diving from February to April; this is also theseason to meet squads of squids. This is a cool encounter I had more than once, and I had never seen so many of them before anywhere else in the world.\nThere are two main routes to Bocas del Toro:air or land+sea. The easiest but not the cheapest is obviously to fly (about 130$). Daily flights from Albrook domestic airport in Panama City link Bocas Town in only 1 hour. As someone who tries to avoid flying whenever there is a good land alternative and enjoys exploring more of the country, I took the road.\nThe cheapest is to take thebus between Panama City (Albrook bus terminal) and l\u2019Almirantevia David, the country\u2019s second-largest city, and through the mountains of Chiriqui (28$). It takes about 10 to 12 hours, and I must warn you about the lack of leg space between seats (and I\u2019m not that tall).\nFrom there, you board aboat to reach Bocas Town on Colon Islandfor 10$, which takes less than 30 minutes. There is also aferry servicetwice a day in each direction for only 1$. Be aware that the boats stop after dark. If you arrive (like me!) after the sun sets, your best chance is to go to the main gas station of Almirante and find a private boat agreeing to take you. I was so relieved I thought it was fair to give the double fare to the lovely family who welcomed me on their boat (instead of paying for a last-minute hotel too)\nThere are also somecomfortable shuttleslinking Bocas del Toro with Boquete (Panama\u2019s coffee capital, a fantastic way to split the journey, 30$ \u2013 boat ride included, it was the best option to stop there on my way back) and Panama City (40$). I also met many people coming from Costa Rica this way (27$ for Puerto Viejo).\nI cannot recommend enoughBocas Dive Center, with its spotless facility and friendly team. The dive centre is on the first floor of theDivers Paradise Hotel, where you\u2019ll also find their restaurant, Pier 19. At the time of my visit, the team of instructors offeredcourses and guided dives in English, Spanish, French, and German.\nTheirlarge boatreminded me of my dives in the US. It was so comfortable, with so much space to gear up and relax at the surface interval. Even if most dive sites are not that far away, I\u2019d go diving anytime in these excellent conditions. Thanks to their dive site by their pier, Mayday, people taking a Discovery dive or doing their Open water training have the best conditions to learn.\nDuring the month I stayed in Bocas del Toro, I also had the opportunity to join theirmonthly dive against the debris. It\u2019s every first Sunday of the month. The dive is free (donations welcome for PADI Aware Foundation) and is the opportunity for a meet-up between local divers and visitors. I loved it, but I soon discovered scuba diving in shallow water with an always heavier trash mesh bag is not as easy as it looked.\nI stayed in 5 different places in one month in Bocas del Toro, including aone-bedroom flatto work from for three weeks. Here are the two best hotels I used at the beginning and the end of my stay.\nRight across the streets from Bocas Dive Center, thePalma Royale hotelis located on thesouth tip of Bocas Town, where it\u2019s mostly quiet at night while being close enough to the lively streets. The hotel offers rooms, suites and apartments with a kitchen. I stayed in a suite with a separate bedroom beside the main room.\nI loved thecoffee cornernext to the sofa, where I could make a fresh brew when waking up or working. The small fridge was convenient for storing the delicious salads from the Super Gourmet Deli right next to the hotel. My balcony overlooked the water, and I could see the ferries coming in the morning.\nGuests who book breakfast with the hotel have to walk 2 minutes to the Buena Vista restaurant, which belongs to the same owner. With a voucher system, you get a deliciouschoice of cooked breakfastserved to your table.\nI will go straight to the point: I absolutely fell in love with theTranquilo Bay eco-lodge. Beyond designingthe most eco-friendly lodgethey could, the American family behind the project also set up a fantastic concept. Every guest is on full board from breakfast to dinner, including drinks AND day activities. Breakfast and dinner were at the main building, and there was a small trail through the jungle to reach it. I\u2019m glad I thought of bringing a head-front lamp for after dinner!\nYou can joinguided snorkellingtours, wildlife spotting hikes, and bird-watching sessions from their canopy observation tower, kayak through a mangrove to a bat cave, or even visit an organic cocoa plantation. Each day\u2019s activity is only in small groups. I joined a dad and his daughter, and we connected quickly. A naturalist guide is always with you and will likely surprise you with their knowledge. They try their best to teach you everything they know (and I\u2019m the non-stop question type!).\nIn 5 days with them, I saw all sorts of colourful poison frogs, met many three-toed sloths and cappuccino monkeys, discovered the oropendola birds and their amazing hanging basket nests and highly recognizable song, and evenfound a fossil shark toothin the bat cave of Bastimentos Island.\nIs something still missing from this article? Do you have any questions?\nPlease let me know in the comments, and I\u2019ll do my best to help!\nThis article was written in partnership with the Bocas del Toro Chamber of Tourism and the Authority of Tourism of Panama. As always, my views and opinions are my own and reflect my experience honestly.\nPIN IT FOR LATER",

        "link": "https://worldadventuredivers.com/malta-itinerary/",
        "content": "Who would have thought I would need 3 trips to Malta to find thebest itinerary to visit the smallest country in the EUas a scuba diver? There are so many tempting dive sites around the islands that if you want to indulge in the wealth of culture on offer, you\u2019d better be organised to make the most of your time. Thanks to my 2-month stay in Malta, I was able to try out just about everything there, and only picked the best for a 2-week stay, including one week 100% dedicated to scuba diving.\nMy itinerary will take you across the 3 main islands:Malta, Comino and Gozo. Feel free to adjust the time dedicated todiving in Maltaif you want to spend more time underwater. Be aware the country is only 316 km\u00b2, so even on the same day, it\u2019s easy to balance it all and cover a lot of ground. Besides my favourite shipwrecks and cavern dives, you\u2019ll find here all my favourite addresses of where to eat and stay.\nPlan your underwater adventures in Malta with the interactive map below. It showcases the main attractions on Malta\u2019s main island, Comino and Gozo and theairport and the ferry terminalsto organise your trip. Note I did most of this itinerary byrenting a car. You will also find some of myfavourite shipwrecksand dive sites.\nI cannot think of a better way to start a trip to Malta than by its magnificent capital city, Valletta. The16th-century fortified citymay have streets perfectly aligned like Manhattan, it is still the smallest capital city in Europe. However, chances are you\u2019ll be baffled like me by the density of treasures to be found corner after corner. No wonderthe entire city of Valletta is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Note, if there is something I learned from my previous stay in Valletta, the best way to enjoy Malta\u2019s capital city is by staying in Sliema, its neighbour city.\nThere is so much to see that you could spend an entire week exploring every street, garden and church. However, to make time for the epic diving awaiting you around the Maltese Islands, here are my personal highlights for a 2-day visit.\nIf you had time only for one thing in Valletta, that would be my pick, plus it\u2019s free. With a perfect mix of architecture, flowers and views, you can\u2019t go wrong by visiting theUpper Barakka & Lower Barakka gardenson the east side (the best spots to be early morning). If you are looking for the perfect viewpoint for a selfie, I recommend getting to the west side at the golden hour (1 hour before sunset). Go to the end of theHastings Gardenuntil you find a small parking lot. This is where you have a perfect alignment of Valletta landmarks in the background.\nI didn\u2019t have the time to visit any museum this time as two conferences kept me busy (but I got to see the old campus of the University of Malta thanks to the Rebreather Forum, so there is that!). I kept a fantastic memory of visiting theGrandmaster Palaceand theSt Elmo Fortfrom my previous visit. These two are thebest way to learn about Malta\u2019s historyand understand why Malta became became so famous for wreck diving. During Easter celebrations, I revisited the St John Co-Cathedral, a jewel of Baroque architecture. I also still have a keen thing for Saint Paul\u2019s shipwreck church (it celebrates Malta\u2019s first famous shipwreck).\nMore about museums & monuments in myweekend in Vallettablog post.\nWhile I found Valletta pretty sleepy in 2016, things have significantly changed. It\u2019s almost a party every night on the steps ofSt Ursula, St John and St Lucia streets. People enjoy drinks, pizza and an occasional open-air karaoke on the stone steps lighted by suspended glass chandeliers. If you want a table (or a cushion!), it\u2019s better to come before sunset. My go-to address for cocktails, wine and pizza : 33 Steps (185, St Lucia Street).\nTaking the ferry between Valletta and Sliema is the best way to commute while enjoying the best view of the Valletta skyline, especially at the golden hour. What I discovered the first time and confirmed the second is that Sliema is way more than a place to sleep. Beyond having thelargest concentration of dive centres in Malta, its charming streets and rocky beaches made my 1-month stay a delight.\nI guess it\u2019s my best travel tip of Malta: if you fancy taking pictures instreets lined up with colourful doors and Maltese balconies, Sliema is a much better setting than Valletta. I recommend the area between Stella Maris and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart churches. My favourite spot was the cross-over between Saint Marin, Sir Adrian Dingli and Kbira streets and its iconic British red phone box below a tree.\nSliema has a beautiful6 km long seafront promenadeoverlooking its golden rocky beaches. Carved into the globigerina limestone, at the Fond Ghadir beach, you\u2019ll even find pools that were made in the 19thcentury but got named the \u201cRoman Baths\u201d.\nOf all my pleasant morning or evening walks, the most stunning is definitely Tign\u00e9 Point.The view of Valletta is breathtaking at twilight, after sunset, when the lights are switched on. Note that Tign\u00e9 Point used to be a canon battery of the British troops who left in the 1960s, so you\u2019ll find many surprising shapes carved in the rocks where the canons used to be. Access is straightforward from the walking board near The Point, a shopping mall.\nEvery time I went eating out, Sliema never disappointed. The variety of restaurants is just baffling, and the prices are more than decent. But if you\u2019re not staying a month like I did, take the opportunity to focus on the Maltese gastronomy restaurants.\nI have two addresses, approved by locals,Ta\u2019Karolina\u2013 151 Tower Road \u2013 andGululu\u2013 133 Spinola Bay (this one is actually in St Julians, which is close enough). Any meal usually starts with a platter of Maltese \u201ctapas\u201d such as sheep milk cheeselets, olives, sun-dried tomatoes and white beans. The influence of Italy is never too far, as many dishes involve pasta but with a Maltese twist (I passed on the Rabbit sauce, but loved the raviolis & pasta with cheese and olives, or sometimes cappers).\nNot only are there excellent shore dive sites right in the heart of Sliema (Tugboat II), but since most of the diving in Malta is shore diving, dive centres drive you all around the island no matter where you stay (so better to stay in a lively and charming area, right?). I recommend planning forat least 3 days of diving, including 2 in Zurieq (UM El Faroud shipwreck) and Cirkewwa (P29 & Rozy shipwrecks). While diving at the UM El Faroud, the #1 wreck dive in Malta, make sure to stop at theBlue Grotto viewpointon your way in or your way back.\nLearn more aboutscuba diving in Malta.\nNo hesitation this time. Stay away from Saint Paul\u2019s Bay and stay in Sliema. It\u2019s central, next to Valletta, with plenty of yummy and reasonably priced restaurants, direct access to a lovely long seafront promenade, and all the best dive centres are a short walk away. Since I worked remotely in Malta for an extended time, I rented an apartment for a month. However, for 2 nights before and after, I tried two different types of accommodation: a hostel and a luxury resort. This way, you can pick what fits your budget!\nAll adventurers deserve a treat! After a 2-week marathon of conferences and an intense week of wreck diving, when I gave back the keys of my flat in Sliema,I couldn\u2019t dream of a better place to staythan theAX Palacein the heart of Sliema. If you can, pay the extra to get a room on the upper floors becausethe views of Valletta from the balcony are incredible at sunrise and sunset. My room was incredibly tastefully decorated, and the bed was a dream.\nTheoutdoor rooftop poolwas perfect for a refreshing swim and a cocktail. In the evening, the indoor pool, with its sauna and hammam, was the cherry on top of my relaxing stopover before moving to Gozo. While I wasn\u2019t too impressed with the breakfast, I booked a table one night at their Asian restaurant on the rooftop next to the pool. Whether you like eating Thai, Indian, Japanese, or a mix of everything, they have it all, and it tastes as it should, and the service is top-notch. Top tip: when booking the table, ask for a table near the windows with views of Valletta.\nWaiting for my flat to be available, I booked 2 nights in a hostel inSt Julian\u2019s near Sliema. I thought it was the best way to start my stay in Malta as hostels are usually fantastic places to meet with other travellers and gather valuable tips.\nAnd this is precisely how it went atMalti hostel. I must admit, I picked this one because they also offered private rooms at a great price (40\u20ac a night in April), it was close to Balluta Bay, and they have a jacuzzi on their rooftop. Well, I discovered later the water of the jacuzzi was pretty cold, and in the chilly temperatures of April, I couldn\u2019t stay longer than 5 min! Anyway, I love thecosy living room and kitchen that worked perfectly to socialise with the other guests, even if my room was in another building, but literally next door.\nIf you have already searched about what to see in Malta, you surely stumbled upon the50 shades of blue of Comino Blue Lagoon. When I went for the first in the middle of the summer in 2016, there was already a bit of a crowd, but it was nothing to compare to the craziness I saw even at the beginning of spring now (note water is between 16 and 17\u00b0C at that time of the year). So, while there is no denying it is a beautiful spot worth seeing,finding a way to do it differently will be a game changerin your experience.\nIf you still want to take one of the boats leaving from Sliema, St Paul\u2019s Bay or Mgarr in Gozo to visit the island independently, at least do it a weekday andavoid weekends at all costs, and if possible, in the shoulder season (the best time would be June or September). Share your time between the lagoon and hiking the rest of the island (beautiful cliffs on its northern shore).\nI went this time on a scuba diving boat from Malta and the other time on a kayak from Gozo. Feel free to move around this day on your itinerary depending on whether you visit Comino from Malta\u2019s main island or Gozo.\nSinceDive Systems Malta, the dive centre I was diving with in Malta, also had a boat at the quay of their sister dive centre in St Julian, we sailed off directly for an exciting boat diving trip in Comino. We explored theP31 shipwreck(the best wreck dive for beginners) and theSanta Maria Caves(allowing us to see the cliffs of the northern shore at the same time from the sea). We stopped at theblue lagoon for our surface interval, and I must say it was delightful to enjoy it with a cup of coffee from the boat\u2019s sun deck.\nLearn more aboutdiving in Comino.\nIt was the best way to enjoy Comino\u2019s splendid coastline away from the crowd while slowly appreciating the details: the beauty of thearches and the narrow canyons in transparent turquoise watercan only be seen from a kayak. I joined a guided tour withGozo Adventuresfrom Hondoq Harbour. We went for 4 hours, including crossing the channel between Gozo and Comino (twice! I\u2019m still impressed I managed to do it). The tour included a1-hour stop at the Blue Lagoonso we could take a few pictures and then escape paddling away.\nDon\u2019t make the same mistake I did on my first diving trip to Malta, and stay at least a few days on the archipelago\u2019s second-largest island. I can bet you\u2019ll be as much charmed as me byits nature, authenticity and gastronomy, and wish you would have stayed longer. The excellent news about Gozo for scuba divers is that you can visit some of the most famous sights of the island on your daily dives, especially Djwera Bay (The Blue Hole & Inland Sea dive sites) and Xwejni saltpans (Double Arch & Cathedral dive sites).\nI listed below my top selection of places you won\u2019t see if you only go scuba diving. They should be on your itinerary for a balanced overview of the island. In that case, the best thing to do is to go on a mini-road trip for a day or two.\nThe city is located right in the centre of Gozo, and from its highest point, the Citadella, you have a360\u00b0 view of the entire island. Victoria deserves to spend at least half a day packed with things to see. Its centralised bus terminal connects to every corner of the island so you can quickly come to town by bus (it took me only 10 minutes from Xlendi), or if you rent a car, it\u2019s easy to park near the bus terminal. From there, it takes 10 to 15 minutes to climb up to the Citadella.\nThe first part is built up, while the part in the back is the remaining ruins of a village. Entering the Citadella, you immediately face Gozo\u2019s Assumption of Our LadyCathedral at the top of a large, elegant flight of stairs. Around it is a choice of museums such as the Archeological Museum and the Gran Castello house (Ask for the special pass for Citadella \u2013 5\u20ac \u2013 or the entire island of Gozo \u2013 13\u20ac \u2013 and you will save on the total).\nOnce in the back, we can only witness thevillage ruins where Gozitans took refuge every summer when pirates used to attack. After a change of law in 1637, cramped houses were abandoned; they collapsed and were never rebuilt. However, the maze of cobblestone alleys still has its charm, and here and there, a few hidden gems deserve appreciation. The triple arch passageway is one of them. From there, you can access the highest part of the wall of the Citadella for a breathtaking bird-eye view of Gozo.\nThe perfect way to end your visit to Victoria is by heading for lunch or dinner around the Independence or St George squares, next to each other. My favourite address? Caf\u00e9 Jubilee, for a simple lunch with hearty traditional raviolis, a glass of gozo wine or a delicious homemade strawberry lemonade (Independance Square).\nThe collapse of the Azure Window left a big hole in the cliffs of Dwejra Bay and in the hearts of all Gozo lovers. But rejoice, not all is lost; the geology of Gozo had made this wonder of nature a twin that was kept away from most tourists\u2019 eyes so far. Reaching the Wied-il-Mielah arch on the northern shore of Gozo is undoubtedly a bit more adventurous.\nQuickly nicknamed the\u201cnew Azure Window\u201d, you\u2019ll find it at the end of a small country road through the stone-walled fields. You either need torent a car, or you\u2019re in for quite a hike since the nearest bus stop is at the Ta Pinu Basilica (40-minute walk each way).\nThe arch is at the end of a narrow canyon, so the best view is either from the stairs going down (be careful the guardrail is in poor condition) or from the top of the cliff a bit away from it (be even more cautious, no guardrail at all).\nI went three times to get a chance to get pictures with the best light and as few people as possible.The Instagram \u201csecret\u201d location is indeed not a secret anymore. But when I went for sunset, I don\u2019t blame people for turning in; it\u2019s a fabulous spot. Most people were respectful and rather respectful of everyone trying to get their dream selfie.\nYou cantry early morning, when the sun shines from behind the cave, lighting beautifully Ramla Bay, the golden sandy beach underneath. Unfortunately, the weather wasn\u2019t with me when I tried it, but it was indeed quieter. But on my last attempt at sunset, I realised that most people come by bus and stop relatively early. So, by coming to the cave in June when the sunset is the latest, you have more chances to have the cave for yourself if yourent a car.\nIf you\u2019re a foodie, you\u2019ll love Gozo. With olives, grapes and all sorts of fruits and vegetables growing locally, going ontasting tours in vineyards and farmsis something you must do while in Gozo. I took the opportunity to visitTal-Massar Wineryin Gharb andTa Mena Wineryin Xewkija.\nAt Tal-Massar, I had a full oenology session about Gozo wines in the middle of their vineyard. We tasted their entire range, fromcrisp floral whites to spicy full-bodied reds. At Ta-Mena, while their estate is on the road to Masalforn (which I visited too on my last day in Gozo), they have a shop and a tasting cellar next to where they produce wine and olive oil, which gives the opportunity to see the other side of the process. Named after the grandmother of the current owner, Marija, their estate produces many products on top of wine: it\u2019s the perfect place to shop for yummy souvenirs from Gozo. My favourites? The olive oil, thesweet tomato pasteand the lemon sea salt flakes.\nAnd as a final note, it is in Gozo that I found thebest local gastronomy restaurants. Here are my top 3 addresses:\nWhile Malta\u2019s main island is mostly about wreck diving, Gozo is theparadise of enthusiast cavern divers and nudibranch lovers(this second point came as a total surprise). If you only have a few days in Gozo, I recommend focusing on the 2 unique spots below, Dwejra Bay and Xwejni. But I recommend planning forat least 3 days of diving.\nLearn more aboutscuba diving in Gozo.\nThe world-famous Gozo Blue Hole is usually on every diver\u2019s list. Make sure to have time to appreciate the surrounding landscape by going on ashort walk to the top of the cliff overlooking the Blue Hole. Make sure to make it a 2-tank trip as the Inland Sea, right next door is a fantastic wall dive at the end of an impressive narrow and deep canyon. Both can be dived by beginner divers, but be aware of the sporty approach to the Blue Hole fully equipped.\nIt was my favourite spot on the island of Gozo in 2016, and it still is. Thesaltpans carved into the golden globigerina limestone form a mesmerising geological lace, especially from the viewpoint of Zebbug. The incredible dive sites off the saltpans\u2019 shores I could explore are Double Arch and Cathedral (but there are more). Double Arch is only for advanced and experienced deep divers, but Cathedral is fully accessible to beginner divers. The new access to the Cathedral is now fromWied-el-Ghasri, a stunning creek at the west end of Xwejni saltpans. While the water entry is much easier than I experienced, be aware of the 100 stairs you\u2019ll have to climb back after the dive.\nI tried 3 different types of accommodation in Gozo: a 4-star hotel in Xlendi and a farmhouse B&B in Nadur at the beginning and the end of my stay on the island. In between, I stayed at one of the studio apartments above the dive centre (gotta love the compressor as the alarm clock!).\nIdeally located in the centre of Xlendi Bay, theSt Patrick\u2019s Hoteloffers simple but comfortable rooms with balconies with either views of the village (beautiful sunrise in the morning) or sea view (but no direct sunset). Even if your room is on the village side, don\u2019t hesitate to have a drink on their rooftop garden to enjoy thebest view in Xlendi(except maybe for the adventurous ones who manage to reach the top of Xlendi cliff).\nThis family-run hotel is not necessarily the idea you might have of what a 4-star hotel should be, but I loved the location and thebreakfast on their terrace by the seain the morning with pastizzi (Maltese puff pastries). Having the dive centre just across the street was a big plus when diving in Gozo. Note: I stayed in the hotel right before they started refurbishment work. So please, if you stay there and have pictures, send them my way; I\u2019d love to see what they have done with the place.\nI wanted to experience it after my first visit to Gozo. Back in 2016, renting an entire farmhouse with a swimming pool was possible for an affordable price. This is not the case anymore. So, even by sharing with my buddy, it was over our budget. We were so happy to findSunny Villain Nadur, acharming farmhouse rented by the room. It was so tastefully decorated. We had a giant private terrace, a shared kitchen where the owner served breakfast in the morning, and a swimming pool in the backyard. Bonus point: it was located next to the best bakery in Gozo, Mekren\u2019s Bakery, where you can order a delicious veggie Gozitan ftira for 9 \u20ac (ftira is the Gozitan take on pizza).\nIt was mybest experience accommodation-wise in Gozo. However, you\u2019ll need a car to stay there if you are diving in Gozo at the same time (even if going by bus is feasible, you\u2019ll have to stop in Victoria to change buses; it would be a pretty long ride before the morning meet-up time). In my case,I rented a carbut also stayed in Nadur once I was done diving to explore the rest of the island, like the Tal-Mixta cave, only 10 minutes away from Sunny Villa.\nAs you return to the airport, why not spend your 24 hours of decompression before flying with a last road trip? Here is my favourite route along the moststunning natural spots and charming townsof Malta\u2019s main island. It\u2019s up to you to tailor your programme, visiting one or all of these spots, depending on how much time you have left.\nFrom Cirkewwa to Marsaxlokk, Malta shows a more natural side that many people often miss by only staying on the urbanised area of the northern coast where the capital city of Valletta is. Here are the top 4 spots I love to come back to again and again.\nCan we still call it a hidden gem? Maybe, maybe not. It was the first time I heard of it in 3 trips to Malta. I fell for this series of three bays (Golden Bay, Riviera Bay, Janina Bay) surrounded by dramatic hills and cliffs the first time I went there. I went back twice. It quickly became my favourite spot in the Maltese Islands (above the water). There you can swim, surf and hike!\nRiviera Bay might be the ultimate sunset spot on the main island of Malta. Note there is a beautiful and chill restaurant at the beach level (Singita Miracle Beach). Still, I recommend first hiking to thetop of the hill above the Qarraba peninsulafor an unforgettable sunset. Be careful in June when sunsets are pretty late; the restaurant stops serving food at 8 pm. At worst, you can also head back to Golden Bay, to theRadisson Blu Hotel. Their restaurant, Agliolio, is open to the public and has delicious pizzas with gourmet recipes, and they close at 10 pm.\nThe charm ofMalta\u2019s ancient capital(until 1530) deserves a couple of hours to stroll in its narrow streets punctuated with painted doors and blooming flowers. And if my pictures below weren\u2019t enough, what if I told you you can eat the best cakes in Malta there? At Fontanella Tea Garden (1 Bastion Street), you can choose among 20 recipes of homemade cakes (I loved the almond pistachio one, even if I had to take half away since the slice is enormous). On top of yummy treats, their terrace offers a beautiful view of Malta\u2019s northern coast.\nThe Dingli Cliffs areMalta\u2019s unexpected highest point of altitude(253 m, yes, not that much, but still).  Forming an almost perfect straight line, the best viewpoint is obviously from the sea. Still, one vantage point allows a fantastic partial side view of the vertiginous cliffs. One important thing: even on a bright sunny day, the cliffs tend to catch the humidity, and with the warm winds from Northern Africa,clouds form rapidly there. As a result, the cliffs can be completely engulfed in mist sometimes. That\u2019s what happened on my second visit, which was finally sunny. All I got was 15 minutes before the cliffs disappeared for the next hour.\nScuba divers usually have the opportunity to see theBlue Grottoon their way to go diving at the UM El Faroud in Zurieq. If you haven\u2019t seen it, make sure to go, it is an iconic natural site of Malta. The Blue Grotto is a 15 minute drive further down the coast from the Dingli Cliffs viewpoint. And for those who have already been to Blue Grotto, make a stop atGhar Lapsifor a swim. The dive itself didn\u2019t impress me much, but the natural pool did!\nIt was a must-see for this trip, as I could never make it to Marsaxlokk on my previous trips to Malta. The \u201charbour of the south\u201c, as its name means in Maltese, is featured on every postcard from Malta due to its numerous colourful luzzu boats that local fishermen still use. Famous for itsfarmer market and seafood restaurants, I was happy to return on a Sunday when the market is real (the rest of the weeks, it\u2019s only some tourist souvenir stalls). It took me 45 minutes to walk from one end to the other! Fresh fruits, vegetables, cheese, breads, pastries, sweets, fish, and so on\u2026 everything the Maltese islands produce is on the Sunday market. Make sure to make your restaurant reservation for lunch before hitting the market, or you\u2019ll have to wait until 2 pm to find a table available.\nOnce you\u2019re in Europe, getting to Malta couldn\u2019t be easier. There aredirect flights from virtually every central city in Europe. I flew from Paris and flew back to Marseille! Plenty of options from the UK, with flights from all London airports, but also Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and many more. You\u2019ll find something similar for Germany, Spain, Italy, and many other European countries. To find at which dates you can find thebest prices on flights, you can easily compare prices ontrip.com.\nIf you don\u2019t feel like flying, there is a possibility of going there byferry from Palermo or Pozzallo in Sicily, Italy. To get there, note there is anight train going from Rome to Palermo, Sicily (including an incredible cross-over of the Messina Strait of the train on a ferry, yes, you read correctly). As you can see, I looked into the details, but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t make it this time.\nOnce in Malta, you can choose between the fast ferry from Valletta or the slow ferry from Cirkewwa to go diving in Gozo. If you\u2019rerenting a car in Malta(thebest prices are from Luqa airport), then the only option is to drive all the way up north to Cirkewwa and take the slow ferry (only 20 minutes, but you might not be able to hop on the first one due to traffic). Don\u2019t be surprised if you go directly without paying anything; the fare is paid on the way back (4,65 \u20ac as of 2023).\nIf you\u2019re not renting a car, I discovered a new option on my way back from Gozo to Malta: thefast ferry linking Valletta directly to Gozoin 45 minutes only. I found the fare quite reasonable (7 \u20ac as of 2023). Since I took the slow ferry on my way to Gozo and returned with the fast ferry, I only paid 7 \u20ac.\nNote for the budget travellers, you can also reach Cirkewwa by bus. It takes 1h30 with line 41/42 from Valletta bus terminal (2 \u20ac ticket when bought directly in the bus, but you can also buy a7-day unlimited bus pass for 21 \u20ac, which can also be used in Gozo).Malta Public Transportoffers many different packages, including the fast ferry to Gozo, so have a look; it might be cheaper, and you could save a lot of time, too.\nThe scuba diving season in Malta is usuallyfrom March to November, but several dive centres remain open all year. With an average water temperature of 18\u00b0C, you can dive in Gozo in a wetsuit anytime. Even in the winter, with stronger winds, thanks to its numerous shore dive sites around the island,scuba divers can find a sheltered spot every day.\nFrom the end of April to the second half of May, I saw the temperature increase by almost 1\u00b0C every week. Sometimes, the wind could bring back colder water, but I went from 16\u00b0C to 19\u00b0C in 3 weeks. Regarding water temperatures, bringing a semi-dry suit was an excellent choice for this temperature level.\nThe first time I dived in the Maltese Islands was at the end of July. That year, the water temperature was colder than usual, around 20\u00b0C. I wore a 5 mm full wetsuit with a hood, gloves and booties with a warm undersuit below, and I still felt a bit cold. Usually,in the summertime, water temperatures are 24 to 25\u00b0C.\nSeptember is the best time to go diving in Maltaif you want warm water and the best visibility while enjoying a shoulder season. Water has heated up all summer, and you can dive without the crowds and with lower accommodation prices.\nIs something still missing from this article?
